                     LAGRANGE EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

LOUIS,ROBERT   855-88-85-2                   VISIT DATE: 01/10/72

This patient was interviewed and examined by me exclusively.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 67-year-old 

male who has known atherosclerotic coronary heart disease 

manifested by myocardial infarction approximately five years ago.  

He also has congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 

25%, and this is thought to be due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy 

given a substantial history of alcohol ingestion.  Over the past 

several months, he has stopped taking his medicine because he could 

not get to his doctor and felt he could not buy the medicine.  Over 

the past two weeks, he has been beset by palpitations and dyspnea 

on exertion as well as palpitations at rest.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has had no vomiting, diaphoresis, radiation 

of the pain, change in bowel habits or any cough.  All of the 

systems are negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has had no significant surgeries.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  He consumes alcohol slightly, 

once smoked in the past, but does not any longer.  He lives with 

his family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Physical examination shows a 

patient who is awake, alert, calm and oriented.  He is in no 

distress at the time of examination.  EYES:  He had no scleral 

icterus.  NECK:  There was no adenopathy.  His thyroid was not 

palpable.  CHEST:  His chest was clear.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  His 

cardiovascular exam showed a regular rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  

His abdomen was soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  His extremities 

showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  SKIN:  He had no rash.  

NEURO:  Neurologic exam was physiologic.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrocardiogram showed tachycardia and 

T-wave inversion diffusely, which was unchanged from prior 

electrocardiogram.  His CK and troponin were unremarkable.  His 

troponin was 1.1, which was similar to a previous admission.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was treated with beta 

blocker and aspirin in the Emergency Department.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Angina pectoris.

2.  Hypertension.

3.  Tachycardia.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was  

admitted to the Medical service for further evaluation.  He was 

admitted in satisfactory condition.

65 FERRY STREET

BARABOO, UT 11521

Dear Mr. Louis, 





It was very nice to see you again the other day.  I hope you are doing well.  I am writing to let you know about your recent test results.  





The following tests were essentially negative, normal, or unchanged from prior testing and do not require follow-up at this time.

1) Kidney test.

2) Cholesterol.  Your cholesterol results are as follows:

     Total Cholesterol = 129,

     HDL (the 'good' cholesterol) = 43,

     LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) = 70,

     triglycerides = 82.

My records indicate that your total cholesterol has increased since 01/11/2072.  Given your medical history, we would like to keep your LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) below 100.  Please continue to follow a heart-healthy diet.

3) Hemoglobin A1c.  This is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months.  For patients with diabetes, we would like to keep it below 7.  Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 6.5 on 04/04/2073.  It has remained stable compared to the last value of 6.5 on 07/12/2072.  Please continue to check your sugars regularly and take Metformin as prescribed.

4) X-ray.  No fractures were detected on the X-ray of your spine, but it did show changes consistent with osteoarthritis.





The following tests were abnormal or require follow-up.

1) PSA.  As we discussed during our visit, this is a blood test that measures activity in your prostate, and is one way to measure your potential risk of prostate cancer.  This is not a perfect test, and its use for prostate cancer screening is controversial.  My records indicate that your PSA has mildly increased since 4/01/72.  I recommend that you follow-up with a urologist for a prostate biopsy, which we can arrange when you return for your follow-up appointment.  At that time, we will again discuss the specifics of the PSA test and the risks/benefits of different treatment/follow-up options.





If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach me at my office at 191-537-1871.  I will see you on 5/16/73 at 9:40am for our next appointment.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old male who

presents complaining of acute onset of chest pain and shortness

of breath.  The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes,

and a prior MRI who was brought in by Emergency Medical Services

for waking at 6:00 a.m. with chest pain radiating to the left arm

associated with shortness of breath.  Denied nausea or vomiting,

had no fevers or chills.  He received by EMS 2 baby aspirin as

well as 40 of Lasix for bibasilar crackles noted by them in the

Emergency Department.  The patient's old chart was evaluated

which revealed an echo on 11/06/2074 with an EF of 25%, cardiac

catheterization in October 2072 with 30% RCA lesion, and Holter

in January 2072 which showed atrial tachycardia runs.

SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, REVIEW OF SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS,

AND ALLERGIES:  As noted.  Of note, the patient is an active

smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, the patient

was awake and alert, moderately ill appearing in mild-to-moderate

discomfort.  Pulse 90, respirations 20, blood pressure 157/90,

and saturating 97%.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic. 

Oropharynx clear, moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  Supple with no

meningismus.  Flat neck veins.  Respirations showed crackles

third of the way up bilaterally with no rhonchi, rales, or

wheezes.  Cardiovascularly, regular rate and rhythm without

murmurs, rubs, or gallops, 2+ pulses in all extremities.  Rectal:

 Heme-negative brown stool.  Abdomen:  Soft and nontender without

rebound or guarding.  Skin:  Warm, well perfused without

petechiae or lesions.  No edema, no calf or thigh tenderness, and

no CVA tenderness.  Neurologically, alert and oriented x3, normal

mood and affect, and no sensory or motor deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  In the Emergency Department, the patient had an

EKG, which was sinus with ST elevations in leads II, III, and

aVF; when compared with prior, these were new.  Additionally, he

had T wave inversions in leads I and aVL.

The Cardiac Catheterization fellow was notified at 7:55.  Dr.

Brock was at the bedside at 8:03.  The patient received aspirin,

no beta-blockers given, he has apparent heart failure, and
