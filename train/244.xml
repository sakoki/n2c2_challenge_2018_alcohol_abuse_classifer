Medical Record Number:  8751045  Francisco, Xue



Procedure:  The patient is a 56-year-old Spanish-speaking female scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Surgery is scheduled on January 28, 2089 by Dr. Xavier Israel kenneth Xenos.



Chief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient briefly evaluated on 12/30/88 as part of preoperative evaluation for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy then scheduled for 12/31/88.  Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain.  These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal.  Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting.  Patient denies jaundice.  Today, patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank.



At the time of evaluation on 12/30/88 patients had symptoms of URI and LRI.  She reported back/green sputum, mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandson's inhaler.  After consultation with Dr. Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then follow-up with surgeon to reschedule her surgery.  Patient reports that she went to University Hospital and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler.  Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler.  Currently she denies any symptoms of sputum production, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.  Also denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.



Patient does have a history of coronary artery disease.  She is status post an MI 11/82.  Patient had cardiac catheterization at OSH 12/3/82 that reportedly showed a critical mid right lesion and a mild left main and left anterior descending lesion.  12/09/82 patient underwent cardiac catheterization at PVH and a PTCA was done.  Patient did well until 10/83 when she was admitted to PVH with symptoms of chest tenderness, left arm pain, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, dry mouth, shortness of breath, dizziness, and darkening of revision.  Patient did rule out for MI by serial enzymes and there are no changes seen on her ECG.  Patient denies any difficulty with chest pain or left arm pain since that time.  She has had episodes of shortness of breath with exertion however, these seem more related to her respiratory status rather than her cardiac disease.



Stress test done 1/26 showed a normal exercise capacity (METS=7), ECG nondiagnostic for ischemia and the perfusion images were suggestive of anterior ischemia although body habitus limited the interpretation.

Assessment:  

ASA Physical Status II

56-year-old female with a history of CAD, SLE, hypertension, arthritis, asthma and chronic low back pain presents for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Patient originally scheduled for surgery on 12/31/88 however because of LRI surgery was postponed.  Patient much improved, lungs clear, no wheezing, no shortness of breath.  It has only been three-week since her infection and therefore increased airway reactivity may be an issue.  Dr. Hoffman explained this to patient.  Dr. Hoffman also reviewed with patient medications to take prior to surgery 1/28/89.  Currently, patient denies any symptoms of cardiac ischemia.  Does have chronic chest pain/tenderness which is reproducible by palpation.  Patient states that this is not her "cardiac pain".

Radiology:

Dissection Protocol CT of 12-Dec-2091: reveals no evidence of aortic dissection. Complex cyst within the spleen. Uterine fibroids.  Degenerative disc disease.



CXR of 12-Dec-2091: The lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The bones are unremarkable.





EKG:   

12-Dec-2091: Sinus brady with a rate of approximately 50.  Normal axis.  Normal intervals.  No ST elevations or depressions.  Q waves in leads II, III and AVF c/w prior inferior infarct.  Q waves in V5, V6.  Good R wave progression.  No atrial or ventricular enlargement noted.  No change from prior ECG's. 



Adenosine MIBI 6/20/2089: 

 The ECG response to pharmacological stress was  negative for

 ischemia. The myocardial perfusion scans show a small size, mild

 intensity, primarily fixed inferolateral defect consistent with

 prior infarct with substantial residual viable myocardium but only

 minimal stress induced ischemia. Compared to the study of 01/26 with

 treadmill exercise (RPP ~24K) the previously noted anterior wall

 defect is less apparent in the present exam.



CARDIAC CATH OF 12/09/2082:

Successful PTCA of the mid RCA with a 3.0 mm balloon with 20 to 30 per cent residual plaque and a hazzines consistent with possible small dissection.



Pt referred by Dr. YARBROUGH, underwent catheterization for

unstable angina, a positive exercise text and recent myocardial infarction.



PROCEDURE

PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY was performed on the Mid RCA using a maximum balloon size of 3.0 mm advanced through a 9YS7EZ guiding catheter.





Assessment:  Pt is a 59 year old female with h/o SLE, interstitial nephritis, GERD, h/o positive stress s/p RCA angioplasty 2082, and chronic abdominal pain who presents with c/o two weeks of intermittent chest pain reproducible upon palpation who is admitted to rule out MI with one set of negative cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes.



Plan:

1.	Chest Pain: Likely musculoskeletal in nature given reproducibility of pain on palpation.  However, given pt's cardiac history, will obtain two more sets of cardiac markers.  Adenosine stress test scheduled for a.m. with echocardiogram pending, as well.  Pt's Atenenlol switched to Lopressor during admission.  Pt Dilatrate-SR changed to Isordil.    Continuing home meds of Nifedipine and ASA.  Pt to be NPO after midnight for am cardiac testing.



2.	SLE: Continuing home dose of prednisone, as well as Vitamins C and D.  Will notify Dr. Xie that pt is in-house per request of PCP, to determine if any further Rheum w/u is necessary.



3.	GI: Will repeat amylase and lipase.  Prednisone is a known cause of pancreatitis and pt's continued abdominal complaints may be pancreatic in origin. although unlikely as elevation is minimal.

Narrative History

Pt reutrns for f/u.

She has not been taking lipitor for several weeks as ran out and did not refull Rx. 

She has had R shoulder pain for about one month. Pain is an aching quality, minimally alleviated by tylenol, exacerbated by moving rotating shoulder. Does not have frozen shoulder or sensation of morning stiffness. She is able to continue all IADL activities requiring use of the joint but notes the pain has become increasingly bothersome. She notes no weakness of her R arm, no dysesthesias or paresthesias, swelling, or history of injury. 

She has noted burning pain in lower extremities, stocking distribution x 1 year. She has pain described as "pins" from bottom of foot extending up both legs. She has a burning sensation of both legs that she notices particularly at night. Walking does not exacerbate or alleviate this sensation. She has not used anything to relieve the discomfort. She has no symptoms of claudication, no reported cyanosis of her LE digits, and no LE edema.

Assessment and Plan

1. Shoulder pain.

Impingement sign, pain with cross over manouver, and pain with use of shoulder to extend arm are consistent with rotator cuff injury. 

Check shoulder films to exclude acromioclavicular injury or degenerative process.

Renew Vioxx prescription (avoiding NSAIDs) in this patient on prednisone, at risk for gastritis.

2. CAD.

Pt had negative stress MIBI in 12/91 and has not had cardiology follow up for multiple years. She is being referred to the Internal Medicine ward service for consultation. Specifically, she remains on a nitrate (isordil) which may exacerbate GERD. She also merits being placed on an ACE inhibitor to prevent reinfarction.

She is well beta blocked and her BP is well controlled by the current regimen of atneolol and isordil.

Checking fasting lipids.

3. SLE.

She is being followed by Dr. Xie.

She and I are curious about her prednisone dosing and I will discuss the regimen with Dr. Xie. 

4. Prednisone.

Had BD of hip last year which was negative; continues on calcium/vitamin D.

Needs further monitoring of HgbA1C as elevated from prior measurements and hyperglycemic from steroids.

5. Mammogram.

Ordered this visit for routine HCM.

6. Pain control.

She has multiple complaints of chronic pain which are not documented in this note. She has used Vioxx previously and needs Stuart Hospital authorization which is being sought following this visit.

7. GERD. 

Well-controlled with new regimen of Protonix 40 BID.

8. LE dysesthesias.

Remeasuring A1C but unlikely to have microvascular complications without overt DM.

Starting amitriptyline. Pt educated to take prior to sleep and will reassess if sx alleviated.

9. F/u.

Pt will follow up with me in 3-4 months.

 John V. Hood, M.D.



Attending note:

Pt seen and discussed with Dr. Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan.

Pt with symptoms and signs of impingement syndrome due to rotator cuff tendinitis vs partial tear, and also tenderness and positive cross-over test c/w A-C arthritis. Will check X-ray, get PA for Vioxx, and would benefit from PT referral. If no improvement, consider MRI vs empiric subacromial/?A-C joint steroid injection.

Seems to have a painful peripheral neuropathy, cause uncertain. Will try low-dose TCA, would also check B12, consider EMG/NCV.

Will obtain cardiology review for CAD. Regardless of level of lipids, there is evidence for benefit of statin, and would encourage pt to resume. If current chest pain syndrome more likely due to GERD than ischemia, could consider D/C nitrates.

Assessment and Plan

1. Odynophagia/hoarseness/swelling.

Constellation of symptoms concerning for mass effect involving soft tissue. Ordering neck CT I+ to examine for infiltrating process.

If unrevealing would proceed to barium swallow to evaluate odynophagia and hoarseness. 

She will continue current diet as sx do not interfere with consumption.

2. HTN.

Chronic problem. I discontinued isordil recently.

Can increase lisinopril to 10 this visit and titrate thereafter.

I would favor addition of diuretic, HCTZ, for additional management and anticipate BP mgmt will require further polypharmacy.

She is returning on 2/2/93 and will have NP visit.

3. Musculoskeletal pain/deconditioning.

RLE radiculopathy has resolved fairly spontaneously, as did the contralateral presentation, without intervention. She needs to recondition, increase range of motion and physical capacity in order to improve stamina and strength.

She has opted not to follow through with PT.

4. CAD.

Cont ASA, statin, BB, ACE.

5. DM.

Cont glipizide; continue ACE I as above. 

BG 125 today.

6. Lupus nephritis.

Cr stable. 

She has asked me to renew immunomodulatory agents but I would like to defer to rheumatology service.

7. HCM.

Stable. 

Requesting female provider to perform breast/pap. Scheduled for 2/2/93.

Attending note:

Pt discussed with Dr Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan. 

Neck Sx as described. I don't feel a mass or adenopathy, but worth further evaluation with CT, barium swallow if sx persist. BP needs better control, goal 130/80, addition diuretic and increase in ACE-I appropriate.
