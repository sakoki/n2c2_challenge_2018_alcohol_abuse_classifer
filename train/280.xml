EDVISIT^42521583^ZASTROW, IRENE^11/01/85^CONNER, VICKIE

The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation

reviewed by me and I concur.  In addition, I personally

interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who

presents for evaluation of chest pain.  The patient had no

history of coronary artery disease until the last week.  She was

apparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week.  She

had been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort. 

She considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums. 

After approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that the

discomfort was not improving.  She did feel like that she had

less energy for her usual activity.  She went to a hospital there

in her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive

troponin.  She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did

show multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.  She subsequently

underwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.  She did

have recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which was

much more severe, sharper in nature per her description.  She was

told in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.

 She returned home today, called her primary care physician and

was advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. 

She does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvania

earlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of more

severe left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhat

more sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencing

before.  It is not always associated with exertion.  It sometimes

radiates to her left shoulder.  It is not pleuritic in nature. 

It seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low level

of dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since her

discharge from Pennsylvania.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She

is able to lie flat.  Denies any lower extremity edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for type 1 diabetes, which is

fairly brittle per her report.  She is status post MI within the

last week.  She also has a remote history of PE in the past and

is no longer on Coumadin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She lives with her husband

and has recently returned from Pennsylvania.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for CAD.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems are reviewed and are also

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Include insulin, Plavix, aspirin, Nexium, Lipitor,

and atenolol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to iodine and Indocin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 65,

respirations 18, and blood pressure 105/69.  The patient is

awake, alert, pleasant female who is reclining in no acute

distress.  Her head examination is normocephalic and atraumatic. 

Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Her sclerae are

anicteric.  Her conjunctivae are pink and moist.  She has moist

mucous membranes and appears well hydrated.  Her neck is supple

and nontender with full range of motion.  The JVP is not

elevated.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with

equal breath sounds, no respiratory distress.  No accessory

muscle use and no chest wall tenderness.  Her cardiac examination

is regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Her

abdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender.  No guarding, no

peritoneal signs, and no organomegaly.  Her skin is intact, warm,

dry, and slightly pale.  There are no rashes.  Her back is

nontender with full range of motion.  Extremities reveal no

cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Her calves are soft and nontender

with no palpable cords and full range of motion with normal

strength and tone.  She is alert and oriented x3, very pleasant. 

Cranial nerves are intact, and there is no motor or sensory

deficit.  Rectal examination performed by the resident reveals

heme-negative stool with normal tone.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was placed on a cardiac

monitor.  IV access was maintained.  Laboratory studies were sent

and EKG was also ordered.  Her prior records from Pennsylvania were

reviewed.  Her white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 37, and

platelets 285,000.  Her electrolytes are within normal limits. 

Her BUN is 18, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 112.  Her CK here

returned normal at 33.  Her MB was 0.4.  Her troponin returned

elevated at 0.39.  This is in comparison to the troponin from her

records of Pennsylvania, which was 0.2.  Her d-dimer is less than 200.

 Her INR is 1.1.  The patient had an EKG, which showed evidence

of a new T-wave inversions, present on prior EKG from this

hospital.  She was started on heparin for concern of unstable

angina status post MI, remained hemodynamically stable, and is

admitted to the Cardiac Service.

DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain, rule out unstable angina.

DATE OF ADMISSION:  12/06/2085.

This 66-year-old woman phoned my office complaining of exertional chest discomfort.  We instructed her to presented to the Emergency Department at Davis Monthan Hospital.  She had experienced multiple episodes of chest pressure with exertion lasting 5-10 minutes and radiating to her left axilla.

On 10/30/2085, she suffered non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in Pennsylvania and was managed with percutaneous coronary intervention.

Chest discomfort recurred and on 11/03/2085, she was recatheterized at Davis Monthan Hospital where her mid LAD stent was expanded.

She has had worsening substernal chest discomfort over the past two to three days.  Her discomfort is relieved with nitroglycerin.  Overnight, she had on and off chest discomfort with anterior T-wave lability.  She was placed on intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin.

She suffered pulmonary embolism in 2074.   That is when I first met her.  She has gastroesophageal reflux disease.

She is married; her husband works at 24 Hour Fitness as a personal trainer in the weight room.  She does not smoke cigarettes.  She has four children.

Home medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 80 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, insulin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.

The review of systems is negative other than the above.

On physical examination, she appears well.  Afebrile, blood pressure 126/82 mmHg, heart rate 72 and regular, and respiratory rate 13 per minute.  HEENT is normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing or cyanosis, but there is right leg greater than left leg edema.  The skin has no rash.

My assessment is that Irene Zastrow has "small vessel" coronary artery disease in addition to epicardial coronary artery disease.  We will intensify her medical regimen by prescribing higher doses of beta blockade and by initiating a long-acting nitrate.  We will also repeat the chest CT scan to make sure she has not suffered from recurrent pulmonary embolism.

I discussed this plan with her, her husband, and the medical house staff.

Dear Iva:



Irene Zastrow, 66 years old, returned for followup of coronary artery disease and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that she suffered in Pennsylvania on 10/29/2085.  At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.  On 11/03/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent.  On 12/07/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.



She feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have "ramped up" her cardiac medications.  She has no shortness of breath.  She does get occasional abdominal pulsations.  She does get epigastric discomfort.



Current medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.



The review of systems is negative other than the above.



On physical examination, she appears well.  Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14.  HEENT:  Normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The skin has no rash.



Irene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point.



I will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data.



Although theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia, I do suspect she has acid reflux, and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 20 mg twice daily.



I am prescribing physical therapy for her "stiff neck."



I am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations.



I reassured her and told her she is clinically improving.  I will plan to see her again in about four months.



Best personal regards.



Sincerely yours,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman with type I diabetes who comes in today for followup.  We have had heron the insulin pump now for close to six months and recently she had had continuous blood glucose monitoring.  We had gone over these results over the phone and I had made some adjustments.  Particularly she seems to have some late morning hyperglycemia and we decided to change her carbohydrate to bolus ratio during the morning hours and this has resulted in tremendous improvement in her blood sugars.  She brings them in today and the results look excellent.  She has had no other concerns of late.  We have not tested her hemoglobin A1c in a long period of time, so she comes in today for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for the type I diabetes as described, her pernicious anemia, C6-C7 vertebral degenerative disease, pulmonary embolus and also some mild asthma in the past.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Prior surgeries are complete hysterectomy about 15 years ago and a single oophorectomy.  Prior hospitalizations include her PEs in 2083, her tachycardia in 2083.  She had arthroscopic right knee surgery approximately five years ago and she had four live births.  She is currently in menopause.

Paternal grandmother passed away at age 89 and paternal grandfather at 52 from a massive MI.  Paternal grandmother 53 from colon cancer, paternal grandfather at age 89.  She has four children ____ serious medical problems.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise unremarkable except for what is listed already in the HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is generally awake, alert, in no acute distress.  She is 66.5 inches with a weight of 167.5 pounds, which gives her a BMI of 26.7.  Her blood pressure is 110/62 and her pulse is 86.  Generally, she is awake, alert, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII are symmetric and intact bilaterally.  Fundi are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No dullness to percussion is present.  Back exam reveals no spinal, paraspinal or CVA tenderness.  Breast examination reveals no masses or galactorrhea.  Cardiovascular exam, PMI in the mid clavicular line, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdominal exam:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal masses noted.  Anoscopy did not reveal any hemorrhoids.  Neck exam reveals no jugular venous distention.  Carotids are 2+ with normal upstrokes.  Thyroid is 20 g without nodules.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically, she is alert and oriented x3 and has a grossly nonfocal exam.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman who comes in today with review of her type 1 diabetes.  She is doing much better on the pump than she was before especially with the recent adjustments we made.  We will continue with the pump and she will continue to send me her blood sugars every two weeks until we get this under control.  We will check a hemoglobin A1c today.  She is up-to-date with the remainder of her health maintenance including seeing a podiatrist and an ophthalmologist as we had prescribed.
2.  Cardiovascular.  She is doing well on her current regimen.  She is on ranolazine and will continue with this.
3.  Neck pain.  Intermittent neck pain is most likely from degenerative disease.  I did not find anything on neurological exam that was concerning.  I did encourage her to actually take some Naprosyn as needed for this pain, but not to take it on a continuous basis for long periods of time.  She has had some problems with some blood in the stool and I feel that she is due for colonoscopy.  I did recommend that she get one in the near future.  

ADDENDUM:  A pelvic exam was with normal appearing female external genitalia.  Normal vaginal vault, no adnexal fullness felt.  Vaginal Pap was taken.  Greater than 50% of our 60-minute visit was spent going over her pump settings, the appropriate levels for her pump, going over her diet, going over her bowel habits and her etiology of possible blood in her stool.
