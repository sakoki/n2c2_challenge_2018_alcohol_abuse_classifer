Esposito, Perla
#146-55-23-5                                 November 11, 2076
 
Has had no exertional chest pains.  Urinates two to three times a
night but not very frequently during the day.  Ran out of her
Lopressor yesterday.  Continues to have some discomfort in her
right buttock radiating down the side of her leg.  Not happy with
the orthotics that were given her for her arch pain because she can
only use them with bulkier shoes.  Has had some right shoulder
discomfort.  
 
Meds:  Procardia XL 120 mg. q.d.  Aspirin 325 mg. q.d.  Lopressor
100 mg. b.i.d.  Micronase 5 mg. q.d.  
 
W. 141.  176/90 in the left arm, 178/90 in the right.  80.  Good
range of motion of the right shoulder.  There is some crepitance
over the AC joint.  No subdeltoid or bicipital tendon tenderness. 
Full range of motion.  Lungs are clear.  Soft, positive S4.  No
pedal edema.
 
1.  CAD.  Doing well without angina.
 
2.  Hypertension.  I renewed her Lopressor. Will recheck this after
she has been taking both medications faithfully.
 
3.  Diabetes.  Will check a glucose today and I renewed her
Micronase.
 
4.  Question right sciatica.  She is not interested in any invasive
therapy so we will not pursue imaging at this time.  She had a
negative CT in 2073.  I put her on 400 mg. of Motrin three times a
day.
 
5.  Arch pain.  This is clearly not that bothersome that she feels
that it is more important to wear lighter shoes.  
 
6.  Right shoulder pain. She may have some mild rotator cuff
tendinitis. We discussed the importance of not overusing this
shoulder and avoiding lifting anything heavier than a coffee cup. 
Motrin 400 mg. t.i.d. on a full stomach.  I showed her some range
of motion exercises.

Follow-up visit for this 77-year-old Chilean woman. 
 
She comes today bothered by right-sided shoulder pain. On a
previous visit she had complained of this and I wanted to put her
on Motrin but she wanted to try Tylenol. The pain bothers her
sometimes at night and is throbbing. It bothers her when she
tries to attach her bra behind her back. Other than that she has
been doing fairly well. She has not had any chest pains. She has
not had any symptoms of TIAs. She has a lot of concern about her
chronic renal insufficiency and wants to discuss this. 
 
Medications: Lopressor. Hydochlorothiazide. Procardia XL.
Micronase. Motrin. Aspirin.
 
Allergies: Lisinopril causes hypokelemia.
 
Family History: Non-contributory. 
 
Social History: She has a daughter, Rhodes, who has been very
supportive. No cigarettes or alcohol. 
 
Review of Systems: She refuses general GYN screening. She had a
hemoglobin A1C in March, which was 6.4. She had an ophthalmology
exam in September. 
 
Physical Examination: Worried. Weight 131 lb. Blood pressure
142/60. Pulse is 72. Skin exam unremarkable. HEENT: EOMI. No
scleral icterus. No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. I cannot
hear any carotid bruits. Lungs are clear. No murmurs. No gallops.
Benign abdomen. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No pedal edema.
Examination of the right shoulder shows that she has tenderness
on abduction beyond 110 but her most marked tenderness is with
her internal rotation and she is unable to do this further than
L5.
 
Procedure: The right subdeltoid bursa was prepped with Betadine.
The skin was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine in a 27 gauge needle.
The subdeltoid bursa itself was entered with a 21 gauge needle
and a mixture of 1cc of 1% Xylocaine and 40mg of Depo-Medrol was
injected. She tolerated the procedure well.
