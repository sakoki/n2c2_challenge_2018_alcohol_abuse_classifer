My dipstick: gluc 250, no ketones, 1.020, large blood, pH 5.0, 3+ protein, no nitrite, trace leukocytes

Urine spin: peach colored, granular casts, WBCS, rbcs (no dysmorphic), crystals, tubular epithelial cells



Imaging: 

CXR RLL PNA

C-spine - facet joint disease, granuloma in R lung apex

CT head - diffuse periventricular white matter attenuation and

	patchy areas of low density in the deep white matter of the

centrum semi ovale and coronal radiata. There are bilateral vertebral and carotid artery calcifications seen.

CT abd (I-/O-)- Relative iliopsoas fullness on the left believed on account of

	atrophy of the right sided musculature secondary to total hip

	arthroplasty on the right.

	Consolidation and/or atelectasis at the right base.

	Degenerative changes of the spine with spondylolisthesis of L4

	over L5



EKG: Aflutter with variable conduction at 100 -130 bpm



Impression:  79 M found down - fall could have been mechanical, vasovagal, vertebrobasilar disease, cardiac arrhythmia or valve disease, and remained on floor because of dementia +/- delerium, head injury from fall, stroke with weakness.  He was incontinent of urine and stool, though incontinence may have been an ongoing problem.  Aspiration likely, now with PNA.  Physical exam concerning for stroke with R leg weakness, RUE flexion and dysmetria.



Plan:  

1.	Syncope - Tele, TTE, MRI for stroke, MRA for VB dz

2.	New Afib - ECHO, TSH, EKG

a.	Did not respond to metoprolol or verapamil, will load digoxin, con't metoprolol po

3.	PNA - likely aspiration, treat with levo, flagyl, atrovent inhaler

4.	Renal failure - likely prerenal, though sediment exam c/w ATN.  Rhabdomyolysis possible, though CK's only 1000.

a.	Treat with fluids NaHCO3 200 cc / hr, see response in Cr

b.	U lytes, U myoglobin

c.	Renal US if not pre-renal

5.	DM - RISS, hold metformin

6.	Agitation -

a.	May improve with treatment of infection

b.	Seroquel QPM, haldol PRN

7.	Prophylaxis

a.	Heparin SC 5000 BID

b.	Nexium 20 QD

Renal US: Bilateral moderate pelvicaliectasis, new from prior CT from 2109.  Echogenic materials in bladder, presumably blood.  No mass or stones seen.

PROCEDURES:  Whistle tip foley placed and bladder was hand irrigated with 3L NS with large amount of clot removed.  Placed on Murphy drip with lightening of urine over 1 hour. 

ASSESSMENT/RECOMMENDATIONS:
81yo M with gross hematuria with clot, fever, and elevated WBC. Renal US obtained rather than CT scan b/c of elevated creatinine in diabetic patient.
-Admit to Urology service.  Patient needs to be on cardiac monitor.
-IV fluids: D5    NS at 100cc/hr.
-Please obtain CXR and EKG.
-NPO after midnight
-hold coumadin.  Patient receiving FFP to reverse anticoagulation.
-Will continue Levaquin (renal dosing)
-Please send blood cultures and urine culture.
-Will recheck chem. 7, CBC, coags in morning.
