HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 


Mr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago.  He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.  While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as "sharp burning pressure".  He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes. There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.  An EKG was "normal" and he was discharged on NG. Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized. On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have "diffuse CAD" involving several vessels. Stent placement was not attempted. His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward. A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: 


ASA 81 mg
Plavix 75 mg po qd
Bisoprolol 5mg po qd
Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm
Ranitidine 300 mg po qd
Lipitor 40 mg po qd
A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs
Metformin 1000 mg po bid


Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital. He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes. It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:


Testing performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.  Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.  No chest pain was    reported.  Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.    The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.  See exercise report for full ECG details.        Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.      There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.  Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%. No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.       Trace mitral regurgitation.4.  Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.      All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.
  
Mr. Austin has  Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in January.  At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina.   


Glycemic control ahs been variable.  Last HGBA1C in 11/85 was 7.8.  Lately there has been an increase in fating levels.  Today BG 162. Last week 112 at home. He is no longer exercising.  Has nocturia X2 but without dysuria. Denies polyuria, polydipsia, nause, chills and fever. Appetite normal. 


 He has residual right shoulder pain after a fall in Dec 2094 which was significantly improved by  steroid injections. Episode of bilateral low-pitched  ringing in his ears has abated. Uses two pillows. No PND, orthopnea and leg edema. Denies vision changes. .  Denies episodes of light-headedness or vertigo.  


PMHx:
H/O diabetes mellitus type 2 : h/o poorly controlled diabetes, which improved and then deteriorated. 

Cataracts. He was seen by Ophthalmology and was told insurance does not cover cataract surgery which he needs.

Dear Gray:




 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today. As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.  I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.  I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.   



The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.  At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.  He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto. He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal). An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.  An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent. 



Since he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic. Since then, he has had no further episodes. 


ROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope. He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.


PMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).


Meds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening. This is an Equadorian formulation.


SHx:
He does not drink, nor smoke.


FHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60. Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.



On exam, he looks well. His heart rate is in the 64. His blood pressure was 115/70. His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits. His jugular venous pressures were not elevated. His chest was clear to auscultation. His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex. His abdomen was soft. Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses. Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.





In summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease. He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.  I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.



With warm regards,  


Sincerely yours,

Dear Dr. Jean:




 

Your patient Henry Oswaldo was seen today by myself at the Atmore Community Hospital today following coronary artery bypass on August 15, 2096 .  He has had a relatively unremarkable recovery with out complication.  Today,  Mr. Oswaldo  looks and feels well, and complains of no issues.    On examination, the lungs are clear, cardiac rate and rhythm are normal. The  incision is healing very nicely.   


Chest radiograph reveals normal findings.  EKG shows no acute changes and is basically normal.  His rate is mildly elevated today despite being on a beta blocker. 


Patient education was completed with respect to:  medication review, weight restriction/lifting/activities, cardiac rehabilitation.


Overall, I am quite pleased with progress.   He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks.  He  seems to be making an excellent recovery from surgery.  


Thank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman.  I am confident the surgery will afford  significant and lasting benefit and relief from symptoms of angina .  I would consider increasing his Toprol dose, but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in follow-up. I am releasing  him to your care.  We would be happy to see him at any time in the future, if you should so desire.  



With warm regards,  


Sincerely yours,
