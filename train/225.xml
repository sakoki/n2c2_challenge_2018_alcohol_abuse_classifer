	Reason for visit:
   Chest pain, shortness of breath


	Interval History:
   Cardiology Admission for Dr. Paulson

69 y.o. male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 presents today to ODC ED with progressively worsening shortness of breath and intermittent left jaw pain. 

The patient reports having undergone CABG in September 2092 at WMMC after developing jaw pain and shortness of breath. He was told at that time that there might be a problem with one of the grafts. Surgery otherwise uneventful. He was discharged home and developed recurrent symptoms. Cardiac catheterization was performed in early Jan 2093 at BS which, by his report, showed one occluded graft. He underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. Relook coronary angiography was performed about 2 weeks later showing no change. He saw Dr. Paulson for 2nd opinion about 2 months ago. His review of angio from Jan: SVG to mid RCA patent, LIMA to 2nd diagonal patent, SVG to LAD not seen and extensive LAD disease. LAD intramyocardial. LV function normal. Ranexa was added however he has not noted any improvement in jaw pain. He has progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and intermittent exertional left jaw pain partially relieved by 2 s.l. TNG. Despite greatly curtailing his activities, he is having daily symptoms. He has been enrolled at cardiac rehab but can only bicycle 2.8 mins. He phoned Dr. Paulson's office today and was advised to come to the ODC ED for evaluation.

In the ED, he appears comfortable and painfree. Did note some left jaw pain earlier. HR 73 SR, BP 122/71, O2 sat 98% RA. ECG showed NSR rate 71, incomplete RBBB with LAFB, LAE, TWI V1-V2-no important change c/w prior tracing 2/18/93. BNP, CK-MB, and TnT normal. CXR shows clear lungs.

In light of his history of CAD, CABG, prior PCI, and progressive symptoms, admitted for further evaluation.

   Chief Complaint
Cardiology Admission Note
Christopher Powell
# 070 27 68

5/20/94 at 11:30 am

Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD

	
History of Present Illness

This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years. He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB. Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts. He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed. Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms. Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD. There was no PCI option available. 

He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted. Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic. He now presented for cath. 

Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch. The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%. The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis. LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM. RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG. The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent. The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized. The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent. He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

Disposition and Plans
Impression: 69 yo with CAD, s/p CABG with early graft stenosis, now s/p PTCA/stent to mid LAD w/DES

	
Plan:

	
1. Cardiac: HR/BP well controlled. Continue current meds. Full dose ASA and plavix indefinitely. Stop PPI on plavix with new DES. Recently increase lipitor to 40 mg QD- will check fasting lipids in am along with LFT's. Adjust dose further as needed. Remove sheath once PTT normalizes. Ambulate once activity restrictions lifted. 

Continue nitrates for now given intramyocardial vessel and severe native distal LAD disease. Increase activity post DC as tolerated.. 

2. Endo: Diabetic on glyburide- continue for now. Check FS BID- insulin scale as needed. 

3. GI: on protonix- will change to zantac while on plavix to prevent drug interaction with PPI's/plavix. Guaiac all stools

4. Psych: anxiety/depression- continue lexapro

	Reason for visit:
   s/p Coronary angiogram with placement Cypher stent to LAD


	Interval History:
   The patient is a 70 yo male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 which was c/b premature graft failure of the SVG to LAD. Cardiac catheterization was performed in Jan 93 and underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. He was admitted to ODC in May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/ Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until about one month ago when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He presented today for cath which revealed a new stenosis distal to the prior LAD stent which was patent. The lesion was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. he is now admitted to the Cardiology department for post procedure monitoring and arrived to cardio clinic pain free and hemodynamically stable.

	Reason for visit:
   chest pain


	Interval History:
   71 yo male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD/CABG September 2092 which was c/b premature graft failure of the SVG to LAD presents with increasing frequency of left jaw pain and chest pain for the past 4 wks. 

After his CABG, he underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD in 1/93 due to recurrent angina.  He then underwent May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until 11/94 when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He then underwent repeat cath in 12/94 which revealed in stent restenosis of prior LAD stent and was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. 

He reports complete symptomatic relief after his stent in 12/94 and he was chest pain free until about a month ago when he noted left-sided chest pain and left jaw pain that was similar to his cardiac chest pain in the past.  The pain was both exertional and non-exertional.  He also noted gradually worsening exertional dyspnea as well, though he has mostly been sedentary.  He denies any orthopnea, PND, leg edema or palpitations.  He has been compliant with all medications, including ASA and Plavix.  He is currently chest pain free.
