Athina, GA 39341





RE: HEATH, QUINTEN M
      MRN: 8059475
      DOB: 08/02/2095


Dear Dr. Calhoun;


We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism. 


As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169, chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck. 


We. started zoledronic acid IV in 05/2171 that he tolerated fine. 


In addition, we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg/dL and elevated FSH and LH levels. We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.  He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
1. Osteoporosis. 
2. Hypogonadism. 
3. History of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy in 2169, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
5. Hypertension. 
6. Diabetes type 2. 
7. Carotid artery disease, left. 
8. Hypercholesterolemia. 
9. Status post AAA repair in 2165. 
10. Coronary artery disease with status post stent. 


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days. 


MEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day. 


ALLERGIES: Tape. 


SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children. 


Vital signs: Blood pressure 118/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds. Height 5 feet 4 inches. 


LABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09/13/2171. His hematocrit is 39. It was 37 in 02/2171.. Platelets are 179,000. White count 4.8. 


In summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer. The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy. I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism. 


He will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid. 
We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now. 


Please let me know if you have any questions. 


Yours sincerely,

RADIATION ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE


HEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75


REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.


DATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173


REASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).


POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.  He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.  This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.  


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.  He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.  While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.  He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.  In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.  On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.  On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.  On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.  Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.  On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.


He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69. Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).  


INTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.
He has maintained steady energy and appetite.
He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat. Otherwise, he has been doing well.
He denies significant respiratory symptoms. No focal or generalized neurological symptoms. The remainder of review of systems was unremarkable.
