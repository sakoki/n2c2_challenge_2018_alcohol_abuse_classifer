CARDIOLOGY

COQUILLE VALLEY HOSPITAL



Reason for visit:

   NSTEMI



Interval History:

   Multiple risk factors for CAD including DM, HTN, CRI. Developed complaints of exertional dyspnea and fatigue during the spring of 2094. Progressed and she was evaluated by Bonnie Eaves. Bruce protocol was postive at 9 minutes, 64% PMHR. Complaints of dyspnea. EKG with borderline changes. Nuclear images with moderate sized defect of anteroapical zone with partial reperfusion. Some scar. Mild LV dysfunction with EF 45-50% and apical dyskinesis.



8/2094 Admitted to CVH for elective cath. Cath with Dr Vitale found nl LM. 99% subtotal LAD with TIMI I flow. Circ was patent. RCA with proximal 30% lesions and mid 80% lesion. Nl LV gram. Treated with PTCA and stent to mid LAD with mini-vision non-drug-eluding stent (2.5 X 18 mm). Excellent results. Distal LAD with residual diffuse 30-40% lesion. Plan to return for staged intervention to RCA.



9/29/2094 she was readmitted for elective RCA PCI. A relook at her LAD stent found >90% restenosis to proximal edge of LAD stent. Treated with 2.75 X 12 mm TAXUS stent. Tolerated procedure well. Discharged the following day with creat 3.3. Plan was to again return for RCA PCI.



10/94 Cath: patent LAD stents. Mid RCA lesion treated with 2.5 X 13 mm cypher stent. Discharge delayed for neurologic changes (LOC and unresponsive) but EEG, CNIS, CT, all without new infarct (old PCA CVA). 



12/25 Developed SOB and arrived in EW at SMM with chest pain. EKG without changes. Trop +/- but continued to have chest pain. Given previous stents, she was transferred urgently to CVH for cath. 



Past medical history:

   CVA of left PCA territory 2093. No residual. Rx with ASA, folate, niaspan

Complete neurologic evaluation in LOC in 10/94 and previously in 2093

IDDM diagnosed 30 yrs ago on insulin pump

CRI with creat baseline 3.7 (followed by Orlando Ernst) and recent eval by Dr Ratliff for transplant. +proteinuria with nephrotic syndrome. Donor kidney (sister)lined up. No date for transplant made...needs to complete Plavix course first.

   40 y.o. with multiple risk factors for CAD. HTN, high chol, IDDM. Previous LAD stent with restenosis. Then second LAD stent and finally RCA stent. Now with admit for NSTEMI. Transferred for urgent cath. Plan for eventual renal transplant at CVH (had been waiting for Plavix to be completed). Pre-treated with mucomyst. 



Given her previous restenosis, and the fact that further Plavix courses are postponing her renal transplant....she would be best served with CABG if she has restenosis. 



Further plan per Dr Rollins

Follow up with Dr Eaves

	Reason for visit:
   45 y o seamstress with h/o CAD, renal transplant, CVA, here for cardiology FU after having been inactivated from pancreas transplant list.


	Interval History:
        Ms. Fagan notes that she is doing very well.   She does not have any chest pain and only rare dyspnea.   She has not had any dizziness and lightheadedness.
     She had previously been on the CVH pancreas transplant list and had full cardiac workup including recent dobutamine echo which revealed normal LV function and no ischemia.   However, there was concern about her extensive visceral and iliac vascular calcification by CT which rendered her high surgical risk.    She is understandably upset about this reclassification and is here today for an overview of her cardiac status.


	Past medical history:
   IDDM for many years for which she is on an insulin pump.   She now also has a continuous glucometer as she has had a h/o recurrent hypoglycemic episodes
CAD -   s/p PCI LAD 8/94 with subsequent DES to mid RCA and restent proximal edge of LAD stent 9/94.   12/94 RCA stenting.   Repeat RCA stenting 2/96.   70% OMB2 detected.   Subsequent cath no change.
No ischemia by 9/98 dobutamine Echo
Small anteroapical defect with partial reperfusion by 8/97 nuclear, unchanged
LVEF 75%
h/o CHF
