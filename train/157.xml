1. OBESITY - he feels his weight is down a little.  He has been trying to eat

mainly meat and vegetables, but he is "stupid" sometimes and cheats.



2. HYPERTENSION - in good range.  He has been making an effort to avoid Na.



3. PROTEINURIA  - he has been off Naprosyn for about 6 weeks, has appt scheduled with Dr. Fry 6/05.  Will plan to repeat 24 hr urine for protein towards the end of next week.  His pedal edema has improved considerably, so possibly his albumin is better.



4. DJD - Ultam is helpful, but not as good as Naprosyn.  Knees and ankles are stiff and painful, especially if he is active and then sits still for a while.

Also has some pain in left groin/thigh c/w tendonitis.

  There is no evidence of mitral stenosis. There is no evidence of mitral

valve prolapse. There is no evidence of mitral regurgitation by color or

spectral Doppler.



LEFT ATRIUM

  The left atrium is dilated.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

  There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis. The aortic valve is

tricuspid. There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral

Doppler. The aortic root appears dilated. The aortic diameter at the

sinotubular junction is 39 mm.



LEFT VENTRICLE

  The left ventricular size and systolic function are within normal limits.

There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There are no obvious

segmental wall motion abnormalities. The estimated ejection fraction is 69 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

  The tricuspid valve appears normal.

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.

  The pulmonary valve appears normal.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

  The right ventricle is not dilated. The right ventricular systolic function

is within normal limits.



EKG:

EW:  NSR 78 with first degree AV block. PR 0.22. Q waves V1-V4. STE in V1-V6.  ST segment scooping in I and L.  1mm STE in II, III, F.  AVR with 1mm STD.

	habitus of the patient.  





Assesment and Plan: This is a 55 yr old male with cardiac risk factors of hypertension, DM, +FH, low HDL, and obesity who presents with anterior STEMI that was successfully treated with PCI to the LAD



Ischemia:



Treatment

 	ASA 325mg po qd

 	Plavix load then 75mg po qd

 	Continue Vasotec 20mg po qd

 	Initiate Lopressor at 12.5mg po tid and titrate as bp and pulse tolerates (monitor PR which was 0.22 on admit)

 	Lipitor 20mg po qd

 	Reopro for 12 hours

 	IV TNG prn bp control until oral regimen stable



Evaluation/Risk Factor Modification

 	Check homocysteine level

 	Re-check Fasting lipid profile

 	Will need extensive risk factor modication including wt loss, diabetes control, and exercise program



Rhythm:  

 	Routine peri-MI monitoring

 	Replete K and MG prn



Pump:

 	Last known EF 69% with no current signs of failure

 	Gently hydrate following cath

 	Will hold off on lasix (takes this at home for LE edema) while hydrating

 	BP control with Vasotec, Lopressor, TNG prn



OSA:  noncompliant at home with CPAP due to uncomfortable mask

 	Will ask respiratory therapy to initiate in-house and try to find comfortable mask

 	Continue education on importance of compliance with CPAP



DM

 	Check HGA1C

 	CZI for now.  Will gather data for 1-2 days.  

 	Will likely need outpatient treatment.  

 	Initiate oral med at discharge

 	Will need diabetes education



Prophylaxis: 

heparin SQ
