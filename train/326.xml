IORIO, Olivia (9290228)



OFFICE VISIT:  10/14/84



This 28-year-old young woman, status post two failed renal transplants, re-presents for evaluation.  She is less depressed, more upbeat.  Now a year since her father's death (? drug overdose).



She is on tapering prednisone after her severe rejection for noncompliance. She has multiple access problems, history of seizures, and severe hyperparathyroidism.  



Medications:  Her meds include Prednisone 2 mg in the a.m., Nephrocaps, Prilosec 20 q.d., Midodrine 5 mg only before dialysis, Diltanin 400 mg b.i.d., Tegretol 250 b.i.d., Renagel 4 caps at breafast, lunch, dinner, 3 capsules with snacks plus 2 tablespoons Alternagel, Doxepin 50 q.h.s., Coumadin 5 mg, Xanax 4-5 tablets of 0.5 q.d., Celexa 20.



Allergies:  She has allergies to Cipro, Demerol, penicillin, and gets red man syndrome from Vanco if given rapidly.  



She has seasonal allergies and takes Zyrtec 10 mg, Flonase 2 sprays each nostril, Albuterol 2 puffs 4x a day as needed, and Advair 2 puffs as needed.



Social History:  She is taking 1 course at computer school.



Physical Examination: Her blood pressure was 170/90 - this is much higher for her.  She has conjunctival injection, which is her acute red eye of uremia.  Neck is supple.  Carotid upstroke is normal.  Thyroid is not enlarged.  Chest is clear. She is chronically ill appearing.  She has an S4, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Bowel sounds are normal.  She has a graft in her leg.  She as 1+ to 2+ edema. She has been gaining 4 kg in the interdialytic period.



Impression:  Blood pressure is up.  Hold the Midodrine, readjust her dry weight.  She claims it is 45 kg, I think it may be lower.  May need antihypertensives if blood pressure remains elevated. Reinforced the need for calcium/phosphorus management. She will be seeing Dr. Ebert.

     transplant, seizures, hypertension, anemia.

     

 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 29 year old young woman, Status post 2

     failed transplants for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis age 9 months, Status

     post bilateral nephrectomies with a history of seizures and multiple access

     failures admitted for left arm AV fistula revision and thrombectomy. 

     

     ALLERGIES:  Demerol leads to seizure, Penicillin rash, Quinolone seizure,

     Vancomycin Redman's syndrome this med needs to be given over 4 hours.

     

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

SOCIAL HISTORY:former Construction Worker, lives with mother



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: blood pressure is 130/70, pulse 90 and regular.

     Fundi not well visualized. periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, neck was supple, 

     carotid upstroke normal chest clear to auscultation and percussion, S4 no S3 gallop or rub,

     Abdomen, soft, nontender. Bowel sounds are normal. Extremity 

     1+ edema. 

     

IMPRESSION: end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, seizure

     disorder thrombosed A-V fistula, volume overload.



HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent revision of her left upper arm A-V fistulae by Dr. Schmitt

On 8/30/86 without complications. Because her arm was swollen her subsequent dialysis was done 

Utilizing a temporary femoral dialysis catheter. She was noted to be persistently anemic with a 

Hematocrit of 23.3% on 9/05/86. It was felt that her low hematocrit was due to both blood loss from

Persistent severe menorrhagia as well as a dilutional component from fluid overload. She was electively 

transfused 2 units of packed cells on 9/05/86 while on dialysis utilizing her revised A-V fistulae. 

The rest of her hospital course was uneventful. She was hyperphosphatemic in hospital and was given dietary counseling for use of her phosphate binders. She was discharged home with recommendations for a GYN

Follow-up to assess her persistent mennorhagia and for f/u with her vascular surgeon Dr. Schmitt. She will continue 3x/week dialysis in her Educare-Pullman outpatient unit.

ID/CC  30 year old with ESRD/HD with facial swelling 

HPI:     This patient presented to the ED with a 1 day h/o facial swelling.  She also reports diffuse abdominal pain x several days; as well as chills at dialysis on Wednesday.  She   s attended all dialysis sessions recently for her full time; she has had two infiltrations that resulted in early removal from the HD machine, but she made up her time on other days.  She feels she has been becoming increasingly volume overloaded for the last 1-2 weeks; she has requested an additional (4th) HD session each week but her OP center has not been able to accommodate her. 

The patient went to Internal Medicine this AM and had a brachicephalic stenosis dilated near the site of a prior stent.  

Past Medical History    adapted from prior notes

CXR:      Patchy opacity at the medial right lung base which may be related
	to atelectasis or pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
	There is a graft like material in the midline that is unchanged in the previous study 
             and may represent an SVC stent.   

ECG: ST @ 92  Axis    78  LAHB 

Impression
Facial swelling, r/o SVC syndrome
  -It is unclear if the stenosis in the brachiocephalic vein explains the facial swelling. 
  -D/w Dr. Asher, intervention nephrology: thrombosis of another vein not seen at fistulogram might explain symptoms 
  -Infection may be contributing to presentation     she had chills at HD and low grade temp in ED
Pulmonary Infiltrate
ESRD/HD
S/p two failed RTx
Anemia 
Seizure d/o 


Recommendations
IV Abx to cover abdomen, lung, possible intravascular infection
  -Vancomycin 750 mg in HD
  -Suggest Aztreonam or alternative in this PCN/Quinolone allergic patient 
CT Angiogram
Blood cultures - will send from HD 
We will check full set of chemistries in HD
She was not therapeutic on her coumadin and appears to need a higher dose 

HD Plan     3-4-2087 
We will confirm outpatient prescription with OP unit 
   -Tentative Rx:  Opti 160 4 hours  2 K 2.5 Ca bath  UF TBD based on weight 
  -Electrolytes:   K mildly elevated, typical for HD patient after weekend, HD will correct. 
  -EDW/Volume:  Moderately volume overloaded in setting of venous stenosis of access/ plus 2 day weekend. 
  -Anemia:  Continue OP EPO in the form of Aranesp. 
  -Ca/PO4/PTH:   We will recheck PTH in HD.  Please continue Phoslo     Fosrenol with meals. 
   -Access:  L AVF
  -Nutrition: Continue Nephrocaps; 2 gm K+ Diet; 1500 cc fluid restriction

A/P)
SOB: 
Very high pulm pressures with dilated pulmonary arteries especially in comparison to prior echos in the setting of sudden onset SOB and LE edema in a patient who is sedentary and has had thrombotic events in the past makes PE a likely possibility.  Her poorly controlled HTN, LE edema and rales 
make flash pulmonary edema another consideration.  
Despite her lack of a significant smoking history she had emphasematous changes on prior chest CT scans 
and so could be at risk for a COPD exacerbation but she had good air movement w/o wheezes.  Her face appears slightly swollen and she has had SVC syndrome in the past but her facial swelling is likely related to her steroids, she has only mild venous distention on her chest and she claims her fascial swelling is not worse then usual.
&#224;Agree w/ lasix 60 mg iv BID (but pt may be preload dependent w/ such severe pulm htn so we have to avoid volume depleting her)
&#224;V/Q scan and LE dopplers
&#224;If no PE and not better w/ lasix then will need to consider chest CT w/ IV contrast to r/o SVC syndrome and parechymal lund problems.
&#224;When pt feeling better I would check full PFTS to evaluate pulm htn and possibility of COPD.  I would also screen her for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency given the emphysematous changes on prior CT.


RENAL TX:  Cr only mildly above baseline.  Hopefully won&#8217;t worsen w/ lasix.
&#224;check prograf trough
&#224;continue prograf, cellcept, prednisone at usual doses
&#224;given LE edema check uprot/ucr ratio


HTN:  Poorly controlled.  It&#8217;s partly worsenend by her anxiety.
&#224;ativan 0.5 mg iv q 8 hrs prn anxiety
&#224;Labetolol 20 mg IV and start labetolol 100 mg po bid (bblocker effect will slow HR and help flash pulm edema from diastolic dyfct, the combined alpha and beta blockade will give it added efficacy given the severity of her HTN, Norvasc may not be ideal given her LE edema).


???DM:  pt on metformin for &#8220;diabetes prevention.&#8221;  Metformin is contraindicated for Cr greater then or equal to 1.4 in a female pt.
&#224;d/c metformin


H/O METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  Pt on chronic bicarb likely to her baseline mild allograft dysfct.  This can be a sodium load that can worsen her pulm edema.
