RE:  Kathy Joshi
     ILC #158-42-11-2
 
Dear Dr. Taylor:
 
Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus.  She continues to
complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally
secondary to exertion.  These episodes occur on a roughly once a
month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes. 
Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no
effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does
not take Nitroglycerin for it.  A stress test performed last
January showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds
of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak
blood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.  She had no ischemic
EKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI
scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small
surrounding area of transient ischemia.  In addition, there was a
moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-
infarct mild ischemia.  Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266
with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192. 
 
She remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d.,
aspirin 1 tab p.o. q.d, Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., NPH 12 units
S.C. q a.m. with 6 units CZI S.C. q a.m., and 15 units NPH S.C. q
p.m.. 
 
Physical exam reveals a well nourished, overweight woman in no
acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 160/90, heart
rate 67 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 264
pounds, which is six pounds above her weight of one year ago.  The
neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2 + without bruits.  Chest

remains clear.  Cardiac exam reveals normal S1, physiologically
split S2 and a soft I/VI systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen is
benign.  Extremities without appreciable edema.  
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, P-R interval
.22, QRS .10, Q-T .36, axis 20 degrees.  There are isolated atrial
premature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV block
and a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor
nonspecific ST and T wave changes.  Compared to his last
electrocardiogram there has been no significant change.
 
Impression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable
angina.  I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q h.s.
for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to
more aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her
aerobic activity level.  In addition, I have asked her to obtain
her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an
ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above
140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic
antihypertensive therapy.  In addition, as long as she remains
active and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI
stress test in one to one and a half years time.  Beyond this I
have not altered her present regimen. 
 
Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care.
 
Respectfully yours,

Dear Dr. Taylor:

 

Mrs. Joshi returns for followup.  Currently, she complains of

exertional fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and mild peripheral

edema.  Since last seen, she has continued to find it quite

difficult to lose weight, and has thus far declined seeing

members of our obesity clinic.  As you know, in the past, she

also has declined any consideration of attempted cardioversion or

other invasive studies.  Presently, she remains on a regimen of

enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 20 mg p.o.

q.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., isosorbide nitrate 60 mg p.o.

q.d., Avapro 150 mg p.o. q.d., Actos 45 mg p.o. q.d., potassium,

10 mEq p.o. q.d. Pumex 2 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin, magnesium oxide,

Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneous q. a.m. along with 50 units

subcutaneous q. p.m., and Humalog 26 units subcutaneous q. a.m.

 

Physical examination reveals a markedly overweight woman in no

acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106/62,

heart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 and

unlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10

months ago.  The neck is soft.  JVP is flat.  Carotids without

significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a

normal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2/6 systolic

murmur radiating from apex to the base.  No significant diastolic

murmur or rub.  The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.

Extremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses are

intact albeit mildly diminished.

 

Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRS

response.  The P waves are more organized than one might usually

see, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation/flutter as well. 

QRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a prior

inferior myocardial infarction.  Compared with his last

electrocardiogram, there is no significant change.

 

Impression:  Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,

and I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regarding

the essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weigh

reduction program.  I once again have strongly encouraged her to

make an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in

extensive weight reduction.  I also discussed with her my

concerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral

edema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrial

or tachyarrhythmias.  As in the past, she told me that she would

refuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other

studies.  She did, however, agree to continue with her current

medical regimen.  I obtained routine blood studies today to

verify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.

 I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, who

will assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he

next few weeks.  We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylyn

to begin at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., which will help result in some

degree of mild diuresis.  Nonetheless, she understands that

significant weight loss can only occur through a weight reduction

program.  I have of course explained to her the increased cardiac

morbidity associated with her current lifestyle.  Beyond this, I

have not altered her current medical regimen.

 

Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care.

 

Sincerely yours,

EDVISIT^15842112^Joshi, Kathy^07/20/71^KATZ, LAURA

This patient was seen, interviewed, and examined by myself

primarily.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who

presents with body swelling and shortness of breath.  The patient

is unable to say when she specifically noted her lower extremity

swelling.  She states that approximately 1 year prior to arrival

she had to throw out all of her shoes except for 2 pairs because

all those shoes had become tight.  At the present time, the

patient is only able to wear sandals and apparently her

co-workers noted her to be significantly swollen and suggested

that she see a physician.  The patient states that there was no

acute change in her swelling today.  She states that she has had

a cough for 1 month.  Again, there was no acute change.  Today,

she denies any chest pain at any time.  She does complain of

dyspnea and specifically dyspnea on exertion, no PND, no

orthopnea, and no change in her overall energy level.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  MI, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes

mellitus.

MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, aspirin, insulin, Lasix, and Avapro. 

Otherwise as per the written note.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for no tobacco use, no alcohol use. 

The patient works as an animal trainer.  She lives with family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies fevers or chills, chest pain or

palpitations, abdominal pain, or dark stools.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished

female, edematous.  Temperature 100.9, pulse 97, respiratory rate

of 22, blood pressure is 178/64, and oxygen saturation is 89% on

room air and 94% on 2 L nasal cannula.  HEENT is normocephalic

and atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Extraocular motions are

intact.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Neck is supple.  Full range of

motion.  JVD is difficult to assess due to the patient's body

habitus.  Lungs:  Positive crackles in the lower 1/4 of the lung

field bilaterally.  There is no dullness to percussion.  Cardiac:

 Irregularly regular, not tachycardic, no murmur is auscultated. 

Rectal:  Heme-negative stool.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds,

soft, distended, no fluid wave, no hepatomegaly is palpated but

palpation is somewhat limited by the patient's body habitus. 

Skin is warm, dry, and intact.  There are various ecchymotic

lesions on the extremities.  Extremities:  2+ edema of the

bilateral lower extremities in the mid thighs.  Neurologic: 

Alert and oriented x3.  Follows all commands appropriate.  Short

and long-term memories are intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for a chest x-ray which has a

right-sided pleural effusion and increased pulmonary vasculature

as well as stable cardiomegaly.  Glucose of 223, BUN of 31, a

creatinine of 1.2, bicarbonate of 24, CK of 87, BNP of 2570, MB

of 0.9, and troponin which is less than assay.  White count of

5.1, hematocrit of 34.2, and platelets of 124,000.  INR of 4.6.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen, interviewed,

and examined in the Emergency Department with labs and studies

obtained as documented above.  Her past medical records were

reviewed.  The patient is in congestive heart failure.  She

received Lasix and lisinopril as well as aspirin while in the

Emergency Department and she has been diuresing appropriately

after receiving the Lasix.  She has been supplemented with oxygen

by nasal cannula.  The source of her fever is not clear.  She

will need to have a repeat chest x-ray as her pulmonary edema

evidence of cellulitis.  UA is pending.  The patient also needs

serial cardiac enzymes and an echocardiogram but this will be

handled by the inpatient department.  I did speak with the patient's

cardiologist and she will be admitted to the Cardiology Service.

DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is admitted in satisfactory condition.

Benjamin W. Taylor, M.D.

Illini Community Hospital

66 Cardinal Circle

Three Rivers, NM  11424



Dear Dr. Taylor:



Mrs. Joshi returns to the office for routine followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn.  By doing so, her creatinine fell from 2.2 to 1.6 and BUN from 117 to 57.  She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy, as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor.  In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol.  Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall.  Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia.  Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis.  In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071.



Currently, she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight, and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet.  Presently, she continues on a regimen of Toprol-XL 37.5 mg p.o. daily, simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily, potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d., furosemide 160 mg p.o. b.i.d., Coumadin, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Niferex 150 mg p.o. daily, Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.p.m.



Physical exam reveals a pleasant, mildly overweight woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 120/52, heart rate 45 and irregularly regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 253 pounds, which is 12 pounds above her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are without significant bruits.  Chest remains clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are detectable, albeit mildly diminished.



Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds.  There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Compared with her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate at times is slower.



Impression:  Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective, however, I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia.  I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o. daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so.  I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness.  She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future.  Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61.  She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy.  She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency.  In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor.  At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing.  Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program.



I thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.



Sincerely yours,







Brandon W Neilson, M.D.
