Patient comes in today for follow-up of recent hospitalization for L1 fracture following a fall. She was in her usual state of health until 2 months ago when she suffered a mechanical fall while visiting family in South Korea. She sustained an L1 fracture without surgical intervention, and returned to canada where she presented to the ED on 3/9/76 wiht back pain, L1 planar fracture with evidence of minimal cord compressionl She was admitted and seen by neurosurgery who felt that there was no acute indication for surgery. Since then, she has had continued pain in her back with occasional burning in her feet but no numbness or tingling. She would like to undergo surgery at this point because her pain is intolerable. She is in contact with a neurosurgeon at this time regarding when to proceed with surgery.



She is otherwise doing well. ROS positive for chest tightness with walking one block with some feeling of being "winded." She does not have this feeling at rest, and states it has been ongoing for the past year. She describes some peripheral edema, as well as PND.

Assessment and Current Plan:

67 yo F with recent L1 planar fracture and multiple medical problems including HTN and new DM

1.  Neurosurg for possible surgery later this month, percocet for pain control



       - will need PFTs pre-op given some c/o DOE

2.  CV:  will also need nuclear study of heart given anginal sx's and new T wave abnormalities on ECG. Cannot do ETT given resting ECG abnormalities, and will need pharmocologic stress given she cannot walk from back pain.

- will start her on lasix both for BP and for diuresis as she appears volume overloaded.

- will rpt echo if dobutamine MIBI not informative

       

3.optho referral per pt request for eye tearing



        

4.elevated gluc and A1c concerning for new DM. However, given only 1 high b.s documented and A1C borderline elevated, I have advised her that we can probably control this with diet, exercise, and wt loss.She will see nutrition to help her avoid high carb foods and to lose wt . If this fails to control her DM we will start her on Metformin. She will need optho eval for this reason as well.



        5. Pt with strong fhx of uterine ca, wishes to see GYN regarding screening for this. She denies sx's of      vaginal bleeding at this pt.



         6.consider rpt CXR given ?of shadow vs nodule.

71F w/ multiple medical problems, including dCHF, restrictive lung disease, severe polyarthritis returns to clinic doing significantly better for the most part.

Regarding her shortness of breath, she undewent a stress test which was completely wnl. She has also lost some weight (intentional) and states that, although she still gets short of breath with exertion, it is noticeably better.  She is being followed by the pulmonary department and is under consideration for a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

For her cough, the nexium has helped a lot and she likely has sig reflux despite the negative esophagram. The weight loss is probably helping with the gerd as well.

Regarding her arthritis, he L shoulder pain is much improved with PT.  Her biggest complaint at the moment, though, is her low back pain. She was seen in pain clinic for two injections. She states that the injections may have helped for 1-2 days but then the pain returned. She says this is her most limiting symptom. She is begging for narcotics.

Lastly, she has clear stress urinary incontinence, was cleared for a TOT sling but has now decided to push this procedure off until next spring.
