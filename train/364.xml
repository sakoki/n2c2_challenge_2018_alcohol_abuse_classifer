CODE STATUS: unknown



CC/ID:  50yo man with DM and a 7-8 y h/o leg ulcers a/w venous stasis, p/w exacerbation of R calf ulcer.



HPI: This 50 yo man with DM and venous stasis has had chronic leg ulcers for 7-8 yrs.  The shallow ulcer on his right calf has been present for 5 months.  In the past 2 weeks, the patient has noticed increased pain and malodorous drainage from the site.  In the past he has been treated with antibiotics nad unaboots, but he cannot remember which antibiotics have been used in the past.  He denies fevers, chills, n/v/d/c, sweats, dysuria, weightloss or abd pain.

He also mentions that he has a red rash on his right forearm, across his abdomen, on the anterior chest, and in the groin.  Antifungal cream has been helpful for this in the past. 

Upon questioning, he reveals that he has had some mild left sided chest pain for 2 hours, which feels like a "pressure," non-radiating, and associated with shortness of breath.  He sleeps on 4 pillows (but that has been stable for 10 yrs), has occasional palpitations, no diaphoresis, no n/v.

U/A neg.



DIAGNOSTIC TESTS / CARDIOLOGY DATA:

No acute ischemic changes, no signif change from previous.  Pos. PVC.  Pos. PVC and bigeminy on telemetry.



RADIOLOGY:

Lower extremity dopplers neg. for DVT.

Plain films of lower extremities neg. for gas or osteal elevation.





IMPRESSION: 50 yo man with chronic venous stasis and exacerbation of RLE skin breakdown, left shift in WBCs, and chest pain with dysrhythmia.



PLAN:

1.	Cellulitis:  Despite DM and venous stasis, lesion that the patient has is very superficial, and therefore need not be treated as a diabetic ulcer, requiring coverage for pseudomonas and anaerobes.  This is rather a simple cellulitis, and may be treated with Ancef.  Consult wound care nurse to recommend appropriate dressings and care of wound.  Consider c/s surgery for unaboots.  No debridement necessary.  Send blood cx - monitor for bloodstream seeding.  Consider MRI of LE to r/o osteomyelitis, however, doubt such a shallow ulceration could cause it.

2.	Chest pain with bigeminy and PVCs:  Rule out for MI by enzymes x3, as ?new dysrhythmia may signify ?myocardial irritation/damage.  Monitor EKG and telemetry.  If ruled out, consider inpt vs. outpt adenoside mibi.  Check lipid panel to further elucidate CAD risk, possibly start a statin.

3.	Deconditioning/SOB:  Consult PT/OT to assist with mobility and exercise tolerance.  

4.	Prophylaxis:  Fragmin.  Counsel re: weight loss.

Date of Admission: 8/09/2121
Attending: Thomas Wyatt
PCP: Ulisses Xuan (Santa Barbara General Hospital)
Source of History: Patient and medical record

CC/RFA: SOB, extremity edema, abdominal discomfort

HPI: This 53 yoM with a hx of morbid obesity, CHF, COPD, Diabetes and OSA reports a increase in his weight from 395 lb to 450 lb over the last 2-4 weeks. This occurred despite his efforts to lose weight and his active participation in a weight watchers weight reduction program. The weight gain was accompanied by abdominal distension and    bloating   , increased leg swelling and increasing SOB. He also reports severe DoE, with a maximal walking distance of 5-6 steps, as well as a deteriorating a scrotal edema with some dysuria, and rectal incontinence. Since the recent weight gain, he also developed an extensive itchy erythema in his groins.  He denies CP, diarrhea, HA, fever, chills, cough. His PCP prescribed metoclopramid and protonix for his abdominal complaints; however, the patient felt dizzy and dehydrated after taking these medications and decided to discontinue those. He also stopped taking his regular lasix medication about a week ago. Because of his increasing SOB, he called EMS, who found him cyanotic in his apartment with an Sa02 of 73% on RA. 

ED Course: On arrival in the ED, his VS were: T98, BP108/65, RR24, HR100, O2Sa 92% on 4L 02. He received one dose of lasix 80mg iv, urine output unrecorded. He was transferred to Internal Medicine for further management.

EKG: SR @90 BPM, low voltage, 1. degree heart block, right axis deviation

Radiology: 
CXR (portable): Low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vascular redistribution cannot be excluded on this semi upright film.
CXR (pa/lat): Mild pulmonary congestion with cardiomegaly. Small right pleural effusion. Stable elevated right hemidiaphragm.

Assessment and Plan:
53 yoM with hx of morbid obesity, CHF,  HTN, COPD, DM type 2, OSA, p/w increasing SOB and abdominal discomfort.
 
SOB: Most likely related to a combination of CHF flare (due to lasix discontinuation, BNP 1326) and COPD (PFT in 2120 indicated severe obstructive and restrictive deficit). CXR showing cardiomegaly and right-sided pleural effusion, consistent with CHF.  Started on oxygen, lasix, combivent nebs. Will reevaluate cardiac function with TTE. In the absence of CP, PE unlikely.  Cardiac enzymes negative. 
CHF: Currently treated with Verapamil for afterload reduction. Will consider to switch Verapamil to ACEI. Reinitiated Lasix. 
HTN: patient here normotensive. Currently taking verapamil, however, 1. degree heart block. Will consider switching to ACEI. 
OSA: Patient on home oxygen. Will suggest CPAP/BiPAP
Diabetes: Currently taking Glybyride, will obtain HBA1c here, keep on RISS while inpatient.
Abdominal discomfort/bloating: Most likely related to recent weight gain of 30 lbs, diabetic gastroparesis might also be contributing. Patient unable to tolerate metoclopramide. Discussed possibility of gastric bypass, patient rejects.
Rectal incontinence: Might be related to diabetic neuropathy. Patient also unable to perform anal hygiene because of obesity. 
Groin erythema: Suggestive of fungal infection. Will treat symptomatically with miconazole and obtain dermatology consult. 
RLE ulcer: Granulating leg ulcer, Will continue topical care.  
Prophylaxis: Fragmin SQ, Nexium
Code Status: Full

DOB:               3/22/68



Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:



I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.  The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.  The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.  The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.  He has never worn compression stockings.  He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.  To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.  The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT. 
There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.  He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.  He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.  



The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. 



His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.  



The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.  



The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.  He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.



His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.



On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.  He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.  He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.  He has a huge protuberant abdomen.  There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.  He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.  His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.  On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.  He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.  He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.  He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.  The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.



The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.  The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.  It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.  In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.  In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.  In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.  Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.  



In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.  Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.  I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.  Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.  This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.  All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.



The solution to this problem is not an easy one.  With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.  Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.  If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.  I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.  I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.  I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.  I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.  It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.  If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.



Sincerely,






Michael D. Roe, M.D.

ADMIT DATE: 11/22/24

PCP:  Irvin Joshua Morgan, MD

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: William Dugan, MD



CHIEF COMPLAINT

Shortness of breath



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting to the ED with shortness of breath.  
Patient has had 2 prior admission (2121, 2122) for CHF exacerbations, last admission requiring lasix 80 IV TID to diurese 1-3L/day.  Patient states his dry weight is ~380lbs.  He was recently in Amboy after surgery for nonhealing venous stasis ulcer and returned home in 9/24.  Upon returning home his weight was down to 342 lbs, however upon admission it is 409 lbs.  Patients reports the past 3 weeks he has felt abdominal bloating, increased LE edema and increase dyspnea on exertion.  At baseline he is able to ambulate short distances on his cane however now he is barely able to get up off the toilet. 
He also reports increased drainage from his RLE wound.  He reports medication compliance except for missing 2-3 times over the past several weeks.  He reports increased fluid intake including Progresso soup, ice water, diet coke and a &#8216;dash&#8217; of salt to his food.  At baseline he requires 2L O2 during the day and 4L at night.  His CPAP machine has been broken for the past week.  He typically sleeps on 3 pillows but has recently increased to 4.  He awakes from sleep often feeling short of breath and sits on the edge of his bed to catch his breath.  Today he saw his PCP at Saint Mary's Hospital Fallbright Center for the above complaints and was sent immediately to the urgent care clinic.  From there he was transferred to the HBH ED.



In the ambulance he received 40 mg IV lasix x 1 and had 1L of UOP.  In the ED, VS were HR 106, BP 110/80  RR 20  O2 sat 96% on 5L.  He received another 40mg IV of lasix and put out 800 cc.  Labs revealed a K of 3.1, Mg of 1.4, Hct of 35.4 and BNP of 1625.  K and Mg were repleted.  Diltiazem 30mg po x 1 was given for rapid afib.  CXR showed stable interstitial edema.  Patient was admitted to medicine for further work up.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting with shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF exacerbation from right sided failure.  Appears to have class IV disease with symptoms at rest.  BNP is elevated from baseline (584) at 1625 confirming acute exacerbation.  Exacerbation may be from increased Na intake, medicine non-compliance and increased po fluid intake, could also be from anemia.



##: CHF exacerbation &#8211; patient responded well to 40mg IV lasix with UOP of 1 L


Lasix 40mg IV BID titrate to TBB goal of at least -1 L (will likely require more as patient required 80 mg IV TID last admission for CHF)
 
Monitor strict I/O&#8217;s
 
Daily weight (dry weight)
 
Na restrict to 2gm, fluid restrict to 2L/day
 
Continue lisinopril and verapamil for rate control
 
O2 therapy, titrate as indicated
 
If fails to improve with aggressive diuresis, consider PE CT given history of immobility



##: Anemia &#8211; iron studies last done in 2116.


Check Fe, TIBC, ferritin, retic count



##: Diabetes


Hold metformin
 
AC and HS finger sticks
 
Regular insulin sliding scale



##: Venous stasis ulcer


Continue BID ace wraps with calcium algenate and ABDs per vascular surgery
 
Patient has appt Thursday. w/Dr. Roe &#8211; will notify of admission



##: OSA


CPAP will inpatient; will attempt to assist patient obtaining working machine for at home



FEN: Low fat, low cholesterol, no concentrated sweets, 2gm sodium, 2L fluid diet



PROPHYLAXIS

GI: None

DVT: Heparin 5000 units TID (extreme obesity)

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn



CODE:  Full code
