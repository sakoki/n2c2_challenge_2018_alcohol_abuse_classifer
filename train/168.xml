THE SPECIALTY HOSPITAL OF AUSTIN

CLINIC NOTE 

Victor Lujan
SMH#:  018-92-33
March 25, 2073


DIAGNOSIS:

Bilateral hand numbness and pain, recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome.

SUBJECTIVE:

The patient is a 54-year-old right-hand dominant male with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus and renal failure requiring hemodialysis, who was has had bilateral hand numbness for several years, but getting worse within the last year or so.  The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Bilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Multiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin.  Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

On today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.  Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well.  The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.  There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.  Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.  However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.  Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.

IMPRESSION:

As above.

PLAN:

My recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.  In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.  It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.

SDU Admission: 04/27/73



PCP: Elliott

Cards: Alston



Chief complaint

Chest pain



History of present illness

54 year old man with DM1 for >40 years, ESRD on HD, CAD, s/p PCI at VHOC and Sipher stent to LAD (100% lesion) on 4/10. Discharged on heart failure regimen. Developed chest pain last night, pleuritic, different than previous CP. No ECG changes noted in EW, went to Alina Medical where symptoms changed abruptly to 8/10 SSC pressure that was similar to pain experienced at VHOC admission.ECG showed biphasic TWI in anterior precordium V1-V3, and    saddle-shaped    T waves, ST elevations in II/III/aVF. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.2. Patient moved to cath lab for urgent re-look.



In the cath lab, found a widely patent LAD stent with post-stend 40% eccentric plaque. D1 ostial pinch from stent. RCA and LCx patent. No intervention. Transferred to SDU. Currently without chest pain, pressure or discomfort.

	study performed 9/19/71.

	Findings:

	There are old healed fractures of the anterior lateral aspect of

	the left 5th and 6th ribs. No acute fractures are identified.

	There is patchy opacification within the left lower lobe likely

	represents atelectasis.

	IMPRESSION:

	1.  No acute rib fractures.

	2.  Old left healed 5th and 6th rib fractures.

	3.  Left lower lobe patchy atelectasis.

CONCLUSIONS



  Due to the presence of vascular calcification artifact, segmental pressure

however, were normal.

Conclusion:     

 

1. Normal left ventricular size with moderate concentric left ventricular

   hypertrophy.  Overall systolic function is mildly reduced with an estimated

   ejection fraction of 42%.  There is severe anterior and anteroseptal

   hypokinesis, extending from base to apex.  No left ventricular thombus is

   detected.  

2. Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.

3. Borderline left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.

4. The aortic valve is trileaflet with normal leaflet excursion.  No

   significant aortic stenosis or insufficiency is detected.  

5. The aortic root appears normal in size.

6. The mitral valve appears morphologically normal, without prolapse.  There is

   trace mitral regurgitation.   

7. Normal tricuspid valve, without detected regurgitation.  Right ventricular

   systolic pressure could not be estimated due to insufficient tricuspid

   regurgitation.

8. There is no significant pulmonic insufficiency.

9. No significant pericardial effusion.  The inferior vena cava appears normal.

Studies:	

CT I -: NO SIGNIFICANT INTERVAL CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR STUDY.  NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL FINDINGS.



CXR: Cardiomegaly with interstitial pulmonary edema.  The findings

	are more prominent then the prior study from 4/27/73 x-ray.

              

EKG:  NSR 72 with TWF in I and TWI in L unchanged from 9/18



Impression: 

55 yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity. His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits. The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency, opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy. He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners.

 

Recommendations: 

-   check UA, NH3

-   lower systolic blood pressure to below 200, e.g. with Labetalol.

-   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal.

-  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity

-  Check MRI/A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy



This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr Benjamin Iles 



Thank you for this interesting consult.
