Name: Younger, T Eugene

MR#: 6381987

Att: Dr. Gilbert

Cards: Dr. Ullrich

Neuro: Dr. Donovan

Date of Admission: 7/2/88



CC: Lightheadedness, vertigo, and presyncopal sx x several episodes



HPI:. 64 yoM w/ significant PMH for CAD, HTN, GERD, and past cerebral embolism presents w/ 6 hour history of vertiginous symptoms, dizziness, lightheadedness, and feeling "like [he] was going to pass out".  The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was "constantly going out of focus" and inability to "lock in on any one thing".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.



Pt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.  TTE at that time showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.

Plan:

1.	Vertigo: Clinically peripheral disease.  If central, would not expect to be affected by motion, be able to be eextinguished, etc.  

Fall precautions

R/o cardiac ischemia: Troponins, monitor, etc

Consult neurology, Dr. Donovan in am to evaluate pt

Ordered MRA, TCDs, and  other non-invasive studies of circulation

Cont ASA 325mg qD



2.	CAD: Cont ASA, B-blockade, (with parameters) and statin. Restart ARB, per Dr. Ullrich.

3.	HTN: controlled w/ above

4.	General care:  Nexium, pt ambulating; Full diet, cardiac prudent.

Reason for visit:

   F/u of coronary disease and hypertension.   



Interval History:

   Ted continues to feel well. He has not taken nitroglycerine for 6 months. He exercises for 25 minutes 3 days per week on the treadmill and does not get chest pain. He does continue to gain weight because of dietary caloric indiscretion. He is not having any edema or orthopnea. 



Family history:

   Brother has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 



Physical examination:

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 +S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 2+ pedal pulses.

-Neuro:   A&O x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact. 

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and has mild epigastric tenderness, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-BP: 127/55  

-Pulse: 43  

-weight: 185  lbs.

-BMI:   



EKG:

   Sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction defect, poor RWave progression, unchanged from previous.





Impression:

   Ted continues to do well. I discussed with him the reason for his persistent positive stress test and the posterolateral redistribution being related to the circumflex occlusion. There is good collaterals to this territory and I told Ted he needs to continue to exercise to build up those collaterals. We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries.
