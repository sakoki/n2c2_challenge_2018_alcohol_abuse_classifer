Mr. Sparks is a 74 yr. M who was seen by me as a new patient in Nov. 10 and again in Dec. 10. He RTC.



HPI: This visit was supposed to be a preoperative visit prior to his scheduled Feb. 02 right inguinal hernia repair with Dr. Yamaguchi. However, when I saw him in Dec he had inadequate BP control despite Dr. Arias doubling his Lisinopril. I DCed Atenolol and switched him to Labetalol 100 mg BID. Despite some confusion I believe he has done this. He had also been switched from Crestor to Lipitor due to safety concerns. Labs done pre-operatively are notable for:

Creatinine     3.4

LDL          184

nct.           35%



Problems

Adenomatous polyp : May 2078

Gastritis : H. pylori positive

Chronic renal dysfunction 

Diabetes mellitus type 2 

Hypertension 

Hyperlipidemia 

Anemia 

hyperparathyroidism 

Transient ischemic attack 



Medications

Pioglitazone 15 MG (15MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 

Clopidogrel 75 MG (75MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 

Furosemide 20 MG (20MG TABLET take 1) PO BID 

Ferrous GLUCONATE 300 MG PO BID 

Lisinopril 80 MG (40MG TABLET ) PO QD , by Dr. Arias.

Atorvastatin 40 MG (40MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 

Labetalol HCL 100 MG (100MG TABLET take 1) PO BID 



Allergies

Aspirin - ulcer, : Allergy entered as ASA 

Habits: no cigarettes, drugs or alcohol;



ROS: denies weight change, fever, chills, fatigue, blurry vision, chest pains, palpitations, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel/bladder habits, joint pain, dizziness, exanthem, edema. 



PE notable for:

Well nourished well appearing M;

Vital Signs

BP 184/90, P 72, Wt 236 lb

O2 SAT 99 %

HEENT: sclera clear white OU, EOMI, ear canals and TMs wnl AU; oropharynx without lesions.

LN: No palpable neck or SC LN;

Cardiac: RRR, rate 72, no extra sounds

Resp.: good air movement, no accessory muscle use, no adventitious sounds



Plan:

1. Hypertension: continues to be inadequate in a diabetic.We have limited options; increasing Lisinopril did not add much. Switch to Labetalol did not help, but he is also not beta-blocked (HR 72) so I am increasing Labetalol to 200 mg BID.

2. Diabetes: control has been good.

3. Renal insufficiency

4. Hyperlipidemia: we may need to increase Lipitor and/or add Zetia.

5. Right inguinal hernia: RTC one week for hopefully better pre-op. BP

EDVISIT^42272668^SPARKS, CHARLES^8/13/2079^SORENSEN, SAUL

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Leach.  Resident's note

was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me, and I

confirm the resident's findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 74-year-old

gentleman who presents with 2 days of chills, fevers, fatigue,

and increased urinary frequency.  He has no other complaints or

associated symptoms.

Please review resident's note for full details of past medical

history, social history, review of systems, medications, and

allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake, alert, in mild to moderate

respiratory distress, breathing with a respiratory rate at 34,

oximetry noted at 88% on room air, temperature is 102 Fahrenheit,

pulse is 104, blood pressure is 213/89, and oximetry came up

nicely to 93% on 4 liters and 100% on nonrebreather facemask. 

Neck is supple.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Lungs reveal slightly

decreased breath sounds at the bases; however, there are few

crackles noted in the left lower base.  Heart is tachycardic but

regular.  The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is noted at 11.6 and hematocrit

28.2.  This is close to the patient's baseline.  BUN and

creatinine 69 and 5.8, 5.8 is quite elevated for this patient. 

However, he has been evaluated for recent diagnosis of renal

failure by the Nephrology Service.  Bicarbonate is 21 and

potassium is 4.3.  Urinalysis reveals some blood and protein,

otherwise not suggestive of an infection.  EKG is tachycardic

with left ventricular hypertrophy in a strain pattern.  Chest

x-ray shows diffuse fluffy infiltrates bilaterally with bilateral

pleural effusions, few Kerley B lines, and fluid in the lungs

fissures.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was covered with

ceftriaxone and azithromycin for his presumed pneumonia.  He also

received nitro paste for preload reduction as well as a Foley

catheter and Lasix, all for his CHF.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the hospital.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia, CHF, and renal failure.

However,  creatinine has failed to fall below 2's despite treatment for UTI and hydration.  There has been some question of medication compliance previously, as he frequently confuses his meds.

A/P:Mr. Sparks is a 76 y/o M h/o ESRD 2/2 DM s/p LURTx 11/08/80 c/b delayed graft function.  He will be admitted to the Internal Medicine under attending Harold Crosby, M.D. for renal transplant biopsy.

1. Renal - slightly impaired graft function, probaly due to a combination of BPH  vs. increased sensitivity to FK vs. acute rejection . Plan for renal transplant bx this afternoon if possible, if not possible will do first thing in the am.
