Mr. Villegas is seen today.  I have not seen him since November. 
About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because
he was gaining weight.  He does feel that his shoulders are
definitely improved.  It is unclear what he is actually taking, but
I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the
medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension
and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.  He is concerned because of the
relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the
right.  When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he
is going to pass out although this has not actually happened.  This
only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.  He has
no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other
cranial complaints.  
 
On examination today, BP 120/80.  He has no bruits over the
carotid.  He has no tenderness in this region either.  He has good
peripheral pulses at the arms.  His joint examination is much
improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint
synovitis.  
 
Clinical Impression:
 
#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to
Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.  He has stopped the
Prednisone, and I would not restart it yet.  
 
#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid
disease.  Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.  Patient
advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.  He has
been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed
that he continue to do so.  He will follow-up with me shortly after
the ultrasound study.

NAME:    Villegas, Yosef  

MRN:      8249813



S:   Here for follow up of his colonic polyps.  He wants to know the results from

     them.  He is not taking hydrochlorothiazide and is curious about his blood

     pressure.  He said he has cut his alcohol back to 6 pack once a week.  He

     has cut back his cigarettes to one time per week.  He does say he has had

     some problems with his memory recently, although no other manifestations

     of dementia and no difficulty with ADLs.  He says he uses Viagra

     occasionally and it works for him.



O:   Well-appearing male. Blood pressure 142/74.  Chest clear.  COR: No

     murmur.



A:   (1)  Alcohol excess discussed.  I told him to cut it out entirely.

     (2)  Cigarette smoking.  Discussed.

     (3)  Hypertension. Under good control.

     (4)  Elevated lipids.  Will check FLP.

     (5)  Worried about dementia. Will check B12, TSH, RPR for now.

     (6)  Status-post knee replacement.  Gets occasional Vicodin from his

          orthopedist.  Says he wanted 8 Percocet for the next month or two

          that he will take on rare occasions when his pain is more severe, and I

          did give him 8 Percocet.



P:   Follow up with Dr. Hobbs in 3 months.

Reason for Visit

Sternal pain.



History of Present Illness

71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80. He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed. The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath. No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem. No variation with food. No change with position (e.g., leaning forward). Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations. No radiation to the jaw or arm. The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).

 

ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail. He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.

Physical Exam

      General Appearance

Alert, no acute distress, comfortable lying flat on exam table.

      HEENT

PERRL.

Moist mucous membranes.



      Neck

No visible JVD.

No cervical nodes.



      Chest

Lungs clear, good air movement, no crackles, wheezes. No focal rhonchi. No pleural rub.

+ focal tenderness approx 2-3 cm above the xiphoid-- subcutaneous tissue feels a little thicker here, but no fluctuance, erythema, warmth. No sternal movement wiht palpation. No palpable sternal wire.



      Cor/Cardiac

RRR, + systolic murmur, no rub. ?S4.

      Abdomen

Soft, ND, NT. + bowel sounds.

      Extremity

Warm. No edema.



Lab Test

ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis. IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF. Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.



Impression

Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago. Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site. No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection. Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause. Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.

 

Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:





Plan

- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low

- check CXR

- send ESR, CBC/Diff

- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done

- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware

- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum
