record.  

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Possible seizure.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 72-year-old gentleman 

who was brought in after having an episode of being unresponsive, 

per his wife.  He seemed to have his eyes roll back in his head.  

There was no definite tonic-clonic movement.  His wife relates the

negative.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, CABG, seizure disorder.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Patient is a past smoker.

alert but not oriented to date, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  

Normocephalic, atraumatic.  CHEST:  Clear. HEART:  Regular rate.  

ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Nontender.   

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  White count 8.3, hematocrit 36.2, 

creatinine 0.7, CK 107.  EKG shows peak T-waves anteriorly, T-waves 

are peak compared to old.   

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This gentleman had a syncopal 

episode which may represent seizure activity.  Also, with his EKG 

changes, plan is for hospital admission for telemetry, for 

observation, and will also get neurologic consultation.  

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Neurology.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is

Urology Consult Note


Patient Name:  Michael Yee
PH#:  69044681
Date/Time:  12/24/94; 2:30 PM
Attending:  Dr. Quintrell Ferreira


CC:          presumed UTI in the setting of indwelling B ureteral stents


HPI:          77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction (diagnosed 10/93 in the setting of B hydroureteronephrosis and ARF) managed initially with B ureteral stents (most recently changed 2/26/94), currently admitted to the medical service 12/23/94 with FTT, anemia, hyperkalemia, and a presumed UTI.


He was brought to the PH ED yesterday by his wife, who noted that he was lethargic and confused for 3 days (reportedly similar to previous UTI presentations).  She felt that his urine output had decreased at home, and that his urine had been foul-smelling for two days.  He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2U PRBC for HCT 26.  His Cr was elevated at 3.1, and his K was 6.4.  He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues.  The patient has been hemodynamically stable, and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise.


We are consulted with the question of whether his stents may be changed during his current admission.


PMH:        Duchenne&#8217;s muscular dystrophy, COPD (2.5L home O2), IDDM, recurrent UTIs w/ previous Candida tropicalis fungemia (followed by Dr. Phoebe Abreu), B ureteral obstruction s/p ureteral stent placement, CAD s/p CABG, PVD, SZ disorder, hyperkalemia secondary to hyperaldosteronemia (type III RTA), CRI (baseline 1.5)


PSH:        CABG; cystoscopy, B RPG, B ureteral stent placement 11/93; cystoscopy, B ureteral stent change 2/94

RADS:     CT A/P W/O CONTRAST &#8211; pending


A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia, anemia, and a presumed UTI.  His U/A and UCx are not overwhelmingly c/w a UTI, but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations.  He is being managed by ID.  His ureteral stents were last changed 2/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction.  His abdominal CT is pending.  He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission.  As such, we recommend:
--F/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing.
--F/U CT A/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.  Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.  Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.


D/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.  Thank you for allowing us to continue our involvement in the care of this unfortunate patient.

Urology Consult Note 


Patient Name: Yee, Michael
PH#:  12693819
Date/Time: 6/03/95  
Attending:  Ferreira


CC:       Obstructive Uropathy

HPI:      77yM  well known to Dr Ferreira/Wright practice. Muscular Dystrophy, CRI. Stents initially placed Nov 2093 for elevated Cr and CT with hydro (bsl Cr was 1.5-1.7); unknown etiology. Last changed Dec 2094. Continues to present with UTI's intermittently normally treated in ED. This admission presents with renal failure/hyperkalemia (Crt up to 8, K 8), urinary tract infection and mental status changes. 


PMH: Muscular Dystrophy, CRI with baseline of 1.5, hyperkalemia secondary to hyperaldosteronemia (type III RTA) CAD s/p CABG, seizure disorder, fungal UTI, PVD, GERD, COPD (2.5L home O2), IDDM
PSH:  CABG; cystoscopy, B RPG, B ureteral stent placement 11/93; cystoscopy, B ureteral stent change 2/94 and then again 12/94.
MED:    See admission list

            NAD, delirious
            S/NT/ND
            Foley intact with clear urine, soiling of bed, deferred DRE            
LABS:   BUN/Crt: 209/8.5&#224; 7.8, K 8&#224;4.3, 14.6&#224;11/31/313MICRO: UA positive for infection; Ucx and Blood Cx pending RADS:     RUS 3/29: Left kidney not visualized.  The right kidney is without evidence of hydronephrosis.  There is an echogenicity in the right renal cortex compatible with chronic renal medical disease.               Last CT was in 12/94 and showed bilateral stability of stents, no obvious processUnderlying obstruction. 


A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction managed with chronic indwelling stents, the etiology which is unclear, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia and a presumed UTI.  His ureteral stents were last changed 12/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction; in 12/94, left RPG showed hydroureter to UVJ and on the right a distal ureteral stricture was noted at the UVJ. Difficult management issue since fails to follow-up and is normally cared for during acute episode admissions. We recommend:

F/U UCx and continue empiric treatment; managed by ID in the past and their services may be helpful if he doesn&#8217;t respond at present.  
Continue hydration and treatment for hyperkalemia/ARF; may benefit from renal consult given h/o RTA
F/U RUS to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis. Left kidney not well visualized at last US.  Depending on the results of this study, consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.  Needs to be medically optimized prior to undergoing anaesthesia.
D/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.
