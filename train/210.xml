He is a strong positive family history of CAD, father died age 49.  Brother may have CAD.

ECG

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

56 yo M h/o CAD s/p BMS x2 to RCA, HTN, HLD, diet-controlled DM, smoking, p/w chest pain at rest



#) Chest Pain: Certain aspects of the history (similar to previous e/o angina, sudden onset, relief with NTG) are concerning for cardiac cause. The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning. Other etiologies include anxiety (pt described a sense of doom), pulmonary causes (less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia), musculoskeletal (pt denies trauma), PE (pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic).

-Telemetry

-f/u repeat troponin, CK-MB

-If positive will start heparin gtt

-If negative will continue to cycle enzymes

-Treadmill stress w/imaging in AM

-Continue ASA 325mg, Plavix

-f/u LFTs given CK elevation but continue home statin (no increase in dose given c/f statin myopathy)



#) Thrombocytopenia: appears to be longstanding and stable by labs. The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease. Other possibilities include Plavix effect (although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix), alcohol (although pt claims abstinence), or ITP. Hypoproductive etiologies are less likely given nl WBC and Hct. 

-f/u smear

-monitor CBC



#) HTN: Well controlled on arrival

-Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, Propanolol 80mg PO BID (given bradycardia may need to decrease dose although currently tolerating well)



#) HLD: Given CK elevation will defer acutely increasing statin dose

-6/70 lipids LDL 45, HDL 35, TG 123

-Simvastatin 40mg PO qPM



#) DM: most recent A1c 6.7

-FSBG AC+HS

-RISS AC



#) HBV: given h/o HBVcAB pos with HBVsAg neg and HBVsAb neg likely either  chronic seropositive occult HBV with extremely low-level viremia not triggering surface antibody response, or resolved acute HBV having lost high antibody titers over time.

-s/p HBV vaccine x4 doses, most recently 7/70

-f/u repeat HBVsAb repeat to assess response to vaccine

-f/u HBV DNA to eval for occult chronic infection



#) HCV: s/p PEG IFN and Ribavirin 3/65-9/65 with inadequate tx response

-Up to date on HCC screening (AFP and ultrasound within last year)



#) Addiction: abstinent from etoh and IVD &gt;5yrs

-Urine tox

-Encouraged pt to continue to attend AA/NA meetings

-Nicotine patch, consult tobacco cessation

-Will call methadone clinic in AM: Physicians Hospital, 65 Champagne Drive, Freeport, WY 94152 587-033-5624

-Verify methadone dose and let them know pt in hospital

-Continue methadone while in house



#) Bipolar: continue risperdal and neurontin

-f/u with PCP vs. psych to check doses (chart lists risperdal as 1mg PO BID vs. 2mg PO QHS) and Neurontin as 800mg PO BID vs. 600mg PO QID)



#) F/E/N: NPO for stress; D5 &#189; NS while NPO; replete lytes prn K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2

#) Ppx: DVT-ASA/Plavix, hold fragmin given pending heparin gtt decision ; GI-not indicated ; Bowel-colace/senna/dulculax

#) Dispo: likely home pending cardiac w/u

#) CODE: FULL (discussed with patient)
