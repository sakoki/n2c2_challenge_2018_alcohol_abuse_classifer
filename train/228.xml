RE:  Wonda Benitez
     MR #892-76-95-4
 
Dear Usha:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,
hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.  As
you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night. 
She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations
whenever she takes the quinine.  She has not been taking this since
the initial two doses.  I suspect that her leg cramps are probably
secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.  I have told her to eat
a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg
cramps in the evening.  In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus
bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.  There is borderline first
degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged
from previous tracing.  We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid
as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.  She will see me in follow-up in
three months' time.
 
Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular
clinic.
 
With warm regards.
 
Sincerely,

RE: Benitez, Wonda
MR: 89276954
 
Dear Usha:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
Wonda Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up status
post coronary artery bypass surgery and pounding headaches.  As you
know, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior
wall ischemia.  I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new. 
On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not
have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.  Therefore,
I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is
probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not
bypass this area.  She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous
venous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal. 
She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I
recommended we continue her current cardiac medications.  However,
she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a
history of otitis media in her right ear.  Therefore, I think it
wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate
her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.  In the
meantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and
nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during
these episodes.  I suspect that her blood pressure rise during
these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem
with her cardiovascular system.  She will return to see me in
follow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her
cholesterol level.
 
Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your
patient.  Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any
questions.
 
With warm regards,
 
 
Gordon Q. Iniguez, M.D.

Follow-up for labile hypertension.  At the time of our last visit, she 

began Procardia XL 30 mg daily and completed a series of 24 hour urine 

tests.  All of the urine tests returned normal.  After being on the dose 

of Procardia, she noticed some continuation of her symptoms and Dr. Iniguez 

suggested that she increase the dose to two tablets daily.  She has been 

on that dose for the last two weeks and has noticed dramatic change in 

her symptoms.  Shes having much fewer spells and her blood pressure, 

likewise is much lower than it had been.  Overall, she is pleased with 

these results.

 

Her other medications have remained the same although she has 

discontinued using immediate release Nifedipine and Nitroglycerin both 

sublingual and patches.

 

BP initially 142/52, later by me 170/68

Weight 155 lbs.

Pulse 68

Her examination remains unchanged except she has 2+ edema in her left 

leg and 1+ in the right leg.

 

Assessment:  Labile hypertension-clinically improved.

 

Plan:

 

1.  Change Procardia XL to 60 mg once daily and continue other 

medications as is.

2.  I suggested that she return for her regular follow-up with Dr. Gibbons 

and Dr. Iniguez.  I would be happy to see her in the future but do not 

feel that additional visits here are necessary.

RE:  BENITEZ, Wonda

MRN: 892-76-95-4

 

Dear Usha:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing one of your patients, Ms. Benitez, in

my Cardiovascular Clinic today for follow-up status post coronary

artery bypass surgery.  As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having a

terrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest

discomfort.  One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was

fasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.  Both of

these episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.  I

am concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier

Persantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her

test and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine. 

Currently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort.  She

continues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking

corticosteroid shots for that.

 

On physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderly

woman.  Blood pressure is 160/70 in the left arm.  Jugular venous

pulse is not observed.  She has bilateral carotid bruits.  Chest

exam is clear.  Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, a

physiologically split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left

sternal border.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Peripheral exam shows

trace pedal edema.

 

EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute. 

There are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an old

anterolateral MI.  The tracing was otherwise unchanged compared

with previous tracings.

MRN: 892-76-95-4              - 2 -          November 01, 2085

 

 

IMPRESSION:  I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for a

Persantine thallium test as soon as possible.  If she can

exercise on this test, that would be even better. When the

results are back, I will get back you regarding further

recommendations.  My hope is that we will not have to

revascularize her again.  If we do, I am hoping to do so with

potential angioplasty and stenting.  In the meantime, I have

switched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopes

of targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100. 

Her previous LDL cholesterol was 111.  I also suggested to her in

the meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we know

the results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode of

her steroid injection for her back.

 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns

regarding this patient.  Again, thank you for referring her to

our clinic.

 

With warm regards,

Re:  Benitez, Wonda

     MRN: 89276954

 

Dear Usha:

 

I just had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Benitez for a follow up

cardiovascular examination.  She has been reasonably stable since

I saw her last in July.  She has had several episodes of chest

discomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite

transient.  The frequency has been less than one time per month. 

The last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping

mall.  She continued to walk and her symptom resolved.  She has

not had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.  

 

She has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia, denying

transient hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, or amaurosis fugax.  She

denies claudication but does admit to back pain, bilateral hip

pain with walking.  She still notes paresthesias of both feet. 

She continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.

 

Her current medical regimen includes losartan 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

nifedipine XL 60 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,

atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

Synthroid ? 5 mcg five days per week and 10.5 mcg two days per

week, furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n., quinine sulfate 324 mg

p.o. h.s. (for cramping), nitroglycerin p.r.n., Zoloft 15 mg p.o.

h.s., lorazepam 15 mg p.o. q.h.s., magnesium oxide 250 mg p.o.

q.d. and Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. p.r.n. 

 

On examination she appears well.  Weight is 142 pounds.  Blood

pressure is 140/60.  Heart rate is 50 and regular.  Neck veins

are 6 cm above the mid right atrium.  There are bilateral carotid

bruits.  Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to

auscultation.  On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth

intercostal space at the midclavicular line.  There is a 1+ left

ventricular lift.  The first heart sound is normal.  The second 

 

Benitez, Wonda                                    MRN: 89276954

is split physiologically.  There is a grade 2/6 mid systolic

murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along

the left sternal border.  There is a fourth heart sound at the

apex.  Abdominal examination reveals no masses, no

hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are notable for 2+ bilateral

femoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft

pulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalis

pedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal

pulses.

 

Her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree

AV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral

myocardial infarction.  There has been no diagnostic change since

July 18, 2086.

 

Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,

2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery

and a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.  The

velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent

calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February

2086.  

 

Graft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left

femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased

velocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid

thigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086. 

The right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent

with no evidence of significant stenoses.  

 

In summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:

 

1.  Coronary artery disease.  Status post coronary artery bypass

surgery.  LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and

posterolateral left ventricular branch.  She has occasional and

very transient episodes of angina.  I have suggested continuing

her current medical regimen.  As noted previously, I prefer to

manage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.  

 

2.  Carotid artery disease.  She is asymptomatic.  I recommend

periodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound. 

 

3.  Peripheral arterial disease.  Both grafts are patent but the

left femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have

a significant stenosis.  I have asked her to discuss this finding

with you further.

November 07, 2086              -3-

 

 

4.  Hypercholesterolemia.  A lipid profile will be checked today. 

 

 

5.  Systolic murmur and query antibiotic prophylaxis for dental

procedures.  I am evaluating her murmurs, which were presumably

aortic sclerosis and mitral regurgitation, with an

echocardiogram.  

 

Sincerely,

 

 

 

Thomas Waller, M.D.
