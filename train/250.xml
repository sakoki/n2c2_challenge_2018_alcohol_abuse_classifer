RE:  Urania Yerger

     MR #583-48-90-0

 

Dear Dr. Dillon:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first

time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her

coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in

October of this year.  Though you know her history well, I will

recount it for the purposes of record keeping.  Ms. Yerger is

presently 81 years old.  Her vascular risk factors include

diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  She had no prior diagnosis

of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash

pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST

elevation myocardial infarction.  Coronary angiography at the

Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,

thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent

complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal

as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.  Angiography also

revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.  The patient underwent

subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed

by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.  (SVG to

ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).  Ms. Yerger's postoperative

course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient

episode of atrial fibrillation.  

 

Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of

activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending

shopping trips.  Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve. 

She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.  She has

had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein

graft harvesting.  She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA

symptoms or claudication.  

 

Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.  Ms.

Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on

her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a

possible viral exanthem.  

Yerger, Urania

MR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078

 

Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency

(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and

prior right knee replacement.  

 

Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.

day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril

5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.

day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.

 

Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family

members in the area.  She is currently staying with her daughter. 

At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but

is limited by chronic knee pain.  She denies alcohol or tobacco

use.  Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.

 

On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.  She is

comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her skin is warm and dry. 

She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly

on her extremities.  Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate

is in the 70's.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her

carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Her chest reveals decreased breath

sounds at the left base.  There are no crackles or wheezes. 

Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and

rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased. 

There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the

apex.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her extremities are free

of cyanosis or clubbing.  Distal pulses are 1+.  She has mild edema

of the left lower extremity.

 

Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and

intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.

 

Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after

her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid

October.  Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to

persistent pleural effusion.  We will reevaluate today with a

repeat chest x-ray.  In the meantime, I think that we should

continue her oral diuretic regimen.  It is possible that her

persistent rash is related to her Lasix.  Although not certain to

be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today

in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may

resolve.  I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.  We

will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for

secondary prevention.  I look forward to seeing her again in

approximately eight to twelve weeks.  In addition, she will follow-

up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a

persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her

symptoms.

It is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.  Please do

not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

 

Sincerely yours,

RE:  Urania Yerger
     MR #583-48-90-0

Dear Dr. Dillon:

I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in
follow-up of her coronary artery disease (CABG 10/78) and heart failure.  At her last visit her
heart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive.  We increased both her Losartan and
her Toprol dosing.  Today her blood pressure is substantially improved.  She has generally been
feeling well.  She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping. 
She denies orthopnea or PND.  She has had stable ankle edema.  

Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg
PO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.
day, Avandia, and multivitamins.

On physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.  Her heart rate is in the high 60s. 
She is comfortable seated on the examination table.  Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8. 
Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.  Cardiac examination reveals a
non-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.  She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur
at the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border.  She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.

Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.  There are
nonspecific ST abnormalities.

Overall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.  She
has signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.  We elected
to maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg
PO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.

Dear Dr. Dillon:



I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease (CABG in October 2078), hypertension, and heart failure.  Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms.  She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea.  She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.



Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d., glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.d., losartan 100 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Avandia, and multivitamins.



Her blood pressure today is 165/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s.  She is comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves.  There are very rare crackles at the bases.  Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2.  P2 is increased.  There is a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.  She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.



Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals.  There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.



In summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.  She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease.  In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o. q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me.



I look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.  It remains a pleasure being involved in this delightful woman's care.



Sincerely yours,

Infectious Disease Fellow Consult Note



Patient Name:  Yerger, Urania

MRN:  58348900

Location: 47N

Admit Date: 1/21/82

Consult Date: 1/22/82  

 

HPI:  Ms. Yerger is an 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.   



She was initially seen on 11/01/81 after a mechanical fall which resulted in comminuted bimalleolar ankle fracture for which she underwent ORIF on 11/04/81.  She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1/15/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus.  She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal.  There is no operative report from the procedure.  Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed.  Tissue appeared fairly healthy.   

 

She denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle.  She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker.  She has had some mild serous drainage from the ankle, but no purulent drainage.

Impression/Recommendations: 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus, now s/p I&D of the open medial malleolus wound; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.   



The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.  If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.  However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.  



After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.  Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.  Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.  We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.  Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure. 



1.	Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results

2.     Please obtain vanc trough prior to 3rd dose

3.     Please obtain LFTs

 

Patient seen and examined with ID Attending, Dr. Ulysses Xayasane.  

We will continue to follow along with you.  Thank you for the consult.
