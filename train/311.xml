EDVISIT^43294739^FINNEY, INDIANA^08/15/87^NARANJO, KENNETH

The patient was seen and examined in the Emergency Department on

08/15/2087.  The patient was seen by Dr. Kaminski.  I have discussed

the management with her.  I have also seen the patient personally

and reviewed the medical record.  This is an addendum to the

medical record.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female who is

sent in by her primary doctor after having had EKG changes today.

 Her history, which I personally obtained and in review of the

record, she has a history of sarcoidosis, recently has had

increased cough and some shortness of breath, given albuterol

with symptomatic improvement yesterday and returned today with

some persistent pain, which she says is generally related to

cough.  She has had no fevers, chills, or shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.  She is

asymptomatic at this time.  She has had no recent travel.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nonsmoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is very well appearing,

pleasant and in no acute distress.  Her vital signs are stable. 

She is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pharynx and ENT is normal. 

Neck is supple and nontender.  Chest is clear.  Heart is regular

with normal pulses.  Abdomen is soft and nontender without masses

that are appreciated.  Skin is warm and dry.  She has no CVA

tenderness, no back tenderness.  She is awake, alert, and

oriented.  Sensory and motor exam are normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a woman who complains of having had

some chest discomfort.  She has a history of sarcoid and has EKG,

which I reviewed, which shows lateral T-wave changes as suggested

by her referring doctor.  She is pain free.  Initial lab results

show hematocrit of 40, INR of 1, and a troponin which was

negative.

Plan at this time is for hospital admission to rule out MI given

her EKG change.  She looks clinically stable.

EDOBS^43294739^FINNEY, INDIANA^11/04/89^YEAGER, HAROLD

I saw this patient with Dr. Sawyer.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Heart is racing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female

with history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and sarcoid, who

presents with onset one hour prior to admission of left arm

pressure and heart racing.  The patient denies shortness of

breath.  She has no nausea, vomiting, and no fevers or chills. 

She says that she has occasionally had these symptoms in the

past, they have already stopped on their own.  Tonight, they

lasted for approximately 30 minutes prior to calling EMS.  En

route EMS took 12-lead ECG showing a rate of 150, suspected a

flutter and was given 20 mg diltiazem by EMS with no response. 

She describes feeling in her left arm as dull pain, it is 3/10,

and it has not made better or worse by anything.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Please see paper chart.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Please see paper chart.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see paper chart.

MEDICATIONS:  Please see paper chart.

ALLERGIES:  Please see paper chart.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A middle-aged African-American woman,

awake, alert, and in mild distress.  Exam limited by obesity. 

Exam is significant for neck; normal to inspection, supple,

nontender, and unable to appreciate JVP.  Respiratory:  No

distress.  Chest:  Nontender and normal breath sounds. 

Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic at 115 and regular and 2/6 systolic

ejection murmur, no gallop, and no friction rub.  Abdomen:  Soft,

nontender, no organomegaly, and no masses, otherwise, as

documented on the paper chart.

IMAGING STUDIES:  ECG shows a flutter at 150 beats per minute in

ECG #1.  ECG final shows a sinus rhythm at approximately 60 beats

per minute with no signs of ischemia.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history

of occasional brief palpitations now with one hour of continuous

palpitations and ECG consistent with atrial flutter.  She was

given 20 mg of diltiazem IV by EMS.  In the Emergency Department,

she was given 20 mg without significant response, followed by 40

mg ID and was achieved a good response.  As the patient required

a significant amount of diltiazem to slow her rate and convert

her and she is also feeling somewhat nervous, we will keep her in

the Observation Unit overnight.  She should get an oral dose of

diltiazem overnight.  She should get cardiac monitoring in the

morning.

PLAN:  To discuss with KEKELA Cardiology and obtain consultation as

to possible discharge on beta-blockers versus calcium channel

blockers.  If the patient does not have a new symptoms she would

be stable for discharge in the morning.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular

response.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Left arm pain.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  35 minutes.

Record date: 2090-12-14

EDVISIT^43294739^FINNEY, INDIANA^12/15/90^MARTIN, CONSTANCE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female

with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and

atrial fibrillation who comes in to the ER complaining of

sensation of a racing heart since 5:10 p.m. in the evening.  She

said it was acute onset and felt like palpitations.  She also

said it felt like a burning.  She had mild shortness of breath

and left arm achiness.  She had no nausea, no vomiting, no fevers

or chills.  She had no trauma, no lightheadedness, and no

syncope.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes,

and atrial fibrillation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not related.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or occasional alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Palpitations, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, the patient missed two doses today,

aspirin, simvastatin, glyburide and NovoLog.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin and IV dye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 155,

respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 136/52, O2 100% on 2 liters. 

The patient is awake and alert, well developed, well nourished,

talking in complete sentences, in no acute distress.  ENT: 

Atraumatic, normal to inspection.  Eyes are normal.  Neck: 

Normal to inspection, supple, and nontender.  Respiratory:  Clear

to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and

rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry.  Back is nontender. 

Musculoskeletal:  No lower extremity swelling or edema. 

Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.  Mood and affect is normal. 

Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact.  No motor or

sensory deficits.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Initial EKG showed a rate of about

150, unclear.  It seemed that there was T waves in V3.  There is

no evidence of ST elevation MI.  We thought this could be an SVT.

 It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation.  Our

plan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement. 

Prior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal

sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was

clear that there was T waves.  At this point, we decided to give

her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium

3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,

glucose 268.  ALT 19, AST 18, CK 350, alkaline phosphatase 128,

total bilirubin 0.5, CK-MB 5.2, troponin I less than 0.04,

calcium 9.1, and mag 1.9.  White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit

42.7, and platelets 438, 000.  INR is 1.  UA is negative for

infection with trace blood present.

PLAN:  Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient

had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.  If both of

those enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home

from the ED Observation Unit.  It is unclear the etiology of her

arrhythmia.  It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke

spontaneously.  The patient is to follow up with her primary

doctor.

DISPOSITION:  ED Observation Unit.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation, the patient's chart,

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.
