89 James Street, Suite 9                          GREENWOOD, NORA
Lucerne, KY 66922                                      60005814

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Greenwood comes in to urgent care clinic for
hives after taking Keflex.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is a 47-year-old woman with
chronic hydradenitis suppurativa since the age of 18 in her left
axilla and her groin.  She has been to the emergency room
multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.  She has
been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and
dicloxacillin.  She is planning to have her disease surgically
managed in the next few months.  She most recently presented to
the emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage
of her hydradenitis in her groin.  She was given a prescription
of Keflex.  Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed
itching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives.  She
denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of
consciousness.  She called the emergency room and was instructed
to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic
reaction.  So now, she is here for follow up from that.  She said
shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and
itchiness have improved very quickly.  She is still complaining
of purulent drainage around her groin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.

MEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.  She
gets hives from both.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.  Her bilateral
groins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some
purulent drainage.  There is no fluctuance that I could feel.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.  Given the
recent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a
different antibiotic.  She has been on dicloxacillin in the past
with good result.  Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin
compared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for
now.  If this does not work, I think one should consider
clindamycin for treatment.  I will go ahead and give her 14 days
worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D. if
she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.  I also gave
her 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her
prescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day.  She should see her
PCP in two weeks.

 PICH CLINIC VISIT

PT: Nora Greenwood

Date of Visit: 3/24/80

Contact information: 715-007-3511

Id/cc: 48F with PMH of type II DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hidradenitis suppurativa, and new diagnosis of fibromyalgia presenting to PICH for follow-up visit re: 1) DM; 2) HTN; 3) hidradenitis suppurativa 4) fibromyalgia/joint pain.

HPI: Interval hx to be reviewed by each issue.  

1) DM: Most recent HgbA1c on 12/31/79: 7.1 (down from 8.2). Nora reports fasting BS in the 140-150 and pre-dinner BS ~low l00's, but does not always check her FS on a regular basis. Noticed that her FS were running much high (>200) when she was taking the elavil for her fibromyalgia. She stopped the elavil bc of these elevated FS. Continues to take Glucotrol XL 2.5mg qd. Denies any episodes of hypoglycemia, but aware of possible symptoms and knows to keep candy with her at all times. Saw nutrition on 6/5/79 and feels that her diet has improved since this session. Continues to be quite active, walking a lot at her job (RN) and at home. 

2) HTN: Continues to take lisinopril 20mg qd; BP slightly elevated at last visit at 144/68. Plan to repeat BP check today and if still elevated to increase lisinopril. Denies chest pain, SOB, DOE, LE edema, pnd, orthopnea, recent visual changes, palpitations, or headaches. Has been shoveling snow on a regular basis without sob or chest pain. 

3) hidradenitis suppurativa: Nora recently completed 14day course of levaquin for a flare of her hs. In past, treated with diclox and augmentin; however, nora felt that both became less effective with time. Also treated with Bactrim which was d/c'd 2/2 stomach upset. Feels that acute inflammation is better, but still with baseline, fairly severe inflammation, discharge, and pain. Had been seen by general surgery in the past who felt that she needed to be seen by plastics. Was scheduled to see plastics in consultation, but was told that she had to pay 200.00 for visit even though she was free care and could not afford this. Continues to use clindamycin topical gel. Denies fever, chills, night sweats, or n/v. 

4) FIBROMYALGIA/JOINT PAINS: Nora was recently seen in urgent care on 2/13/80 with c/o diffuse joint pains and myalgias x 2 weeks. Urgent care w/u included a negative ana, RF, and normal parvovirus IGM level, but IgG was 7.79% (normal less than 1.1). Seen by Dr. Marshall in Rheum who did not feel that she had a "bona fide synovitis" but considered ddx including fibromyalgia and inflammatory arthritis. Further work-up included a negative anti-ccp, normal EST, and a negative ASLO. He started her on elavil to improve her sleep, but nora stopped 2/2 elevated bs. Does feel that improved sleep significantly improves her symptoms.

----continue ASA 81mg qd, lisinopril 40mg qd
----2/81 urine microalb/crt: 62.8, above goal of <30 and likely due to persistently elevated BP. Adding additional blood pressure agent today (toprol XL) and will re-check malb/crt once BP under better control. 2/81 BUN/CRT: 15/0.7. 
----will perform DM foot exam at next visit. Nora denies any numbness or tingling of extremities at this time.

----11/80 (NON-FASTING): TCHOL: 189; HDL: 48, TRIG: 154, LDL: 110; on Simvastatin 80mg qhs. LDL slightly above DM goal of <100, but Nora has since attempted to increase exercise and eat low fat, low cholesterol diet. Rechecking lipid panel today. 
----OPTHO: will need to confirm appt at f/u visit 2) Hidranitis suppurativa: 
----will confirm referral to plastics and schedule if necessary
----prescribing course of cipro given e/o inflammation (less than previous flares) on exam today. 3) STD testing: Recent rpr, HIV, HBC, and HCV neg. Still not able to test for GC/Chlamydia, but no sx   s at this time to suggest infection. Will continue to offer, but again Nora declined given significant groin HS. 
----recommended HBV vaccination and gave Nora green slip4) Left Shoulder/Arm pain: Suspect multifactorial 2/2 possible rotator cuff injury, biceps tendonitis, and adhesive capsilitis. Offered steroid inject at last visit, but Nora declined and continues to decline. 
----will call about MRI results and consider treatment pnd results5) Pain control/Narcotics log: Given increased use of short-acting percocet, started long-acting MS contin 15mg BID and encouraged use of percocet for break-through pain. No trouble w constipation at this time, but warned Nora of increased risk given daily use of narcotics and encouraged hydration and increased fiber intake. Also reviewed Narcotic log contract and conditions. Nora is aware of conditions and rules as well as risks/benefits of chronic narcotic treatment. She agreed to drug testing today as well as all conditions described in contract.
----checking urine drug test today (Nora affirmed use of valium and percocet at 6:00am) 6) HTN: Still above goal of <130/80 and with e/o microablumin on 2/81 urine test on HCTZ 25mg qd and lisinopril 40mg qd. Will add toprol XL 25mg qd today. Discussed possible side-effects including fatigue, mood changes, etc. 
----scheduled f/u with NP in 10d to re-check BP and HR; consider increasing dose if still not at goal and HR tolerates. Will also assess for development of any SE at that visit. 
----TO DO: review sleep apnea ROS at next visit and will need to re-visit smoking cessation
7) Elevated AP: Suspect 2/2 fatty liver (elevated GGT confirming GI source and RUQ w e/o fatty liver) and asx at this time; continue RF modification (wt loss, strict lipid control). Will re-check in 6 mos (~7-8/81). Consider GI eval if significant elevation or symptoms. 
8) Panic attacks: continue tx through psych (CBT and valium prn). 
----confirm f/u appt w psych at next visit
9) +FH of ovarian cancer (mother, sister, maternal GM died of ovarian CA). Has had multiple previously scheduled appts to see high risk clinic at MTCI. Again offered to re-schedule for her, but Nora said that she had the number and was going to reschedule. Asked her to call me with date to confirm. 
10) TOBACCO USE: Nora reported quitting at last visit but today smelled of smoke. Confirmed that she had restarted, ~ 4 cig/day. Will need to discuss further at next visit and once again review crucial nature of smoking cessation for her.

----MAMMOGRAM: Scheduled on several occasions, but never obtained bc of pain. Nora still feels that examine would be impossible given HS. Will continue to discuss and work to get treatment for her HS. Expressed my concern regarding continual deferral of mammogram and risk for cancer. Nora states that she understands risk but simply feels that it would be impossible given level of pain. I offered to give her pain medications but she still does not feel that she could undergo this test yet. Will continue to discuss with her.
