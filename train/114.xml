Personal Data and Overall Health	

75 year old right handed man with pure motor hemiparesis synrdrome on right from L IC stroke in 6/32.



History of Present Illness	

Mr. Slater comes to the stroke clinic today for an initial visit and second opinion for left-sided weakness starting in 6/25/32. He was golfing at the time, and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes. The weakness involved the face, arm and leg on the left side only. He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220/140 (per his report). A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal. He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA. He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine. They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined. No further stroke/TIA workup was performed.



He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup. His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal. He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability. He did have "flashing lights in both eyes" for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course, but none since then. He has never had transient monocular blindness, diplopia, or suddenly blurry vision.



Past Medical History	

Hypertension.

He is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis. 

He has not had his cholesterol checked.

Coord: nl FNF, HKS bilaterally. Gait normal-based, good toe, heel and tandem walk. 

DTR's: 2 throughout, toes downgoing.



Plan	

I have reviewed Mr. Slater's CT scan, and he has a lacunar infarct of the left posterior internal capsule, which explains his pure motor hemiparesis syndrome. I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension, and to use antiplatelet agents. I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 325 mg per day.



In addition, he needs a work up. I have arranged for him to have CNIS, 24 hour Holter monitoring, and TTE with bubble study. Additionally, we should check fasting lipids. 



He wishes to have a PCP at FPC, and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department, who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds. 



He will return to clinic in 2-3 months, and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns.

Personal Data and Overall Health	

75-year-old S/P L internal capsule stroke 6/32.



Reason for Visit	

Mr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up. I last saw him on 10/1/2132, and he has continued to improvesince that time. He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention, and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension. He has had no new stroke-like symptoms, and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak, usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued. He was recently seen by Dr. Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology. He underwent a 24-hour holter monitor, which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia. His CNIS have no evidence for disease. He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today.



Medications	  

PROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)	 40MG PO BID x 87 days Start Date: 10/1/32 Stop Date: 12/27/32

ATENOLOL	 50MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32

NORVASC (AMLODIPINE)	 2.5MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32



Exam	

Alert, Ox3. Speech fluent, non-dysarthric. 

EOM's full, no nystagmus. 

Face symmetric, full power x 4. No drift. 

Gait steady, narrow-based. 



Plan	

I am pleased with his negative results so far (24 hour holter, CNIS), and I doubt the TTE will change our management. We are likely left with small vessel disease causing a lacune in the internal capsule. The best for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA 325mg per day, and continued treatment for his hypertension, as per Dr. Tolliver. I will see him again in 3 months time, and he will call me in the interim with any problems or questions.

Patient Name: SLATER, OWEN;  MRN: 8635779

Dictated on: 06/14/2138 by URIEL T. ZIRKLE, MD 

 
ATTENDING CONSULTATION NOTE 
 
DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent renal cell carcinoma.  
 
HISTORY: Mr. Slater is a delightful and active 80-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2133. At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy, and the final pathology showed a 1.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans. For the last 2 years, enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy. A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. CT scan was repeated in December of 2137. This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules. Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules. Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer. His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest, which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance.  
 
He has met with Drs. Eagle and Yzaguirre. Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor, perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well. 
  
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
 
1. Hypertension.  
 
2. CVA with residual weakness on the right side. He is, however, still able to walk with a cane.  
 
3. High cholesterol.  
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Norvasc, Avapro, clonidine, Lipitor, and allopurinol.   

DRUG ALLERGIES: None known.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a long retired news writer with a heavy smoking history. He last smoked in 2132. He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases, no abdominal or GI symptoms.  
 

PHYSICAL EXAM:
No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing
No gynecomastia
Respiration comfortable
Mild right-sided motor weakness, walks with a cane. 
No skeletal deformity or tenderness
Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 
Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.
No hernias.
 
 
RADIOLOGY: CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed, the largest being 15 mm across. He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, the largest of which is 14 mm, and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 18 mm. Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance.  
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed.  Lymph nodes will be also be sampled.  
 
For intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow.  Consent obtained today.

CHIEF COMPLAINT
: 
hyperglycemia






HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS





            Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia.  His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair.  Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue.  He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday.  He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG&gt;500.  His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804.  An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s).  His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin.  Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities.  He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.

            On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling tired, but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED.  He continues to have LE edema, which has worsened in the last day.  He denies recent weight loss, fevers, cough, dyspnea or PND, syncope, N/V, diarrhea, constipation, melena, urinary symptoms, joint pain, bruising, worsening rash, skin lesions, double vision, dysarthria, headache, or focal weakness or numbness.

A/P
: Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia


#) Hyperglycemia:
 Elevated glucose, serum osm, lack of anion gap, and absence of urine ketones suggest HHS. Most likely etiology is steroid-induced hyperglycemia superimposed on ? underlying DM (HgbA1c 6.80 in the past).  No e/o infectious-trigger (urine culture negative and CXR equivocal).  Rapidly improving after IVF in ED and insulin.  Current FSBG 330.  Diagnostic evaluation: will send repeat HgbA1c, FSBG before meals, qd electrolytes.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold IVF given new a-fib and signs of volume overload (see below); give 10 U regular insulin now and SSI with meals (convert daily usage to NPH); potassium repletion PRN




#) A-fib:
 New onset a-fib.  Differential includes fluid overload, hyperthyroidism, pre-existing structural heart disease (LAH, mitral regurg/stenosis).  CHADS2 score: 12.5% risk of stroke over the next year if not on anticoagulation.  Currently rate-controlled 80s.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, cardiac monitor.  Therapeutic intervention: d/c amlodipine (given LE edema) and start low dose dilt (30 mg TID) for continued rate control.  On ASA.  Will discuss risks/benefits of coumadin w/ patient and PCP.



#) Troponin leak: In the absence of chest pain/angina or concerning EKG changes, this likely represents heart strain in the context of chronic kidney disease. 
Will trend enzyme, repeat EKG, and monitor for changes in clinical status.




#) Edema
: differential includes congestive heart failure vs worsening kidney disease vs iatrogenic volume overload vs capillary leak syndrome (from steroids, norvasc). 
Given duration, clinical picture, and elevated BNP (although no baseline comparison), concerning for CHF.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, etc. w/ more extensive evaluation as needed.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold lasix given underlying kidney function, continue HCTZ, monitor I/Os.




#) Bullous pemphigoid
: Will restart prednisone taper at 40 mg daily per dermatology outpatient note w/ goal of one additional week, then 20 mg daily for three weeks. 
Will contact dermatology regarding modifications to the regimen, if any.




#) HTN
: Currently well-controlled.  Continue doxazosin 2 mg qHS, HCTZ 12.5 PO daily

Aliskiren/HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and clonidine 0.2 mg PO BID.  Monitor and add additional agents as needed




#) Chronic kidney disease: Cr slightly above baseline, but improving with hydration.  Will monitor.  No current indications for renal replacement therapy.



#) 
? PNA:  Afebrile and asymptomatic (no cough, chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, or left shift).  Will hold antibiotics.



#) Gout: cont. allopurinol (redosed for renal function)



#) FEN: Diabetic diet



#) PPX: GI: PPI; PCP: bactrim; Bowel: none; Steroids: vit D; DVT: heparin
