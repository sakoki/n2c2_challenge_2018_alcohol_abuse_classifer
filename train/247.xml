MOUNTAIN SIDE INTERN ACCEPT NOTE

Patient:  Isenberg, Michael
MRN:  3674193
Date of Admission:  25-March-2064
PCP:  Dr. Charles Uher (DSH)
Attending:  Julian Quintela/Micheal Leyva
 
CC:  Chest pain

HPI:For full details, please see SDU Admission Note of 3/22/64 and SDU transfer note of 3/25/64.  In brief, the patient is a 81 y/o man with CRI, Type II DM and hypertension who was in his USOH until Thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no  radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  The pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.  EMS was called, who brought him to the HCC ED, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an O2 of 85%.  His pain was alleviated with IV NTG, and BiPap improved his O2 saturation.  He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin.  He was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions.  He was sent to the SDU, where he was started on lasix 60IV BID and a CABG pre-op workup was begun.  Since admission to the SDU, he has been stable, with excellent RA sats.  His Troponin-T peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain.
	On the floor, he was stable but had a 15-beat self-limited run of MMVT, his BP was 110/60 and he was asymptomatic, with no chest pain or dyspnea.  He was given 4 gm iv of MgSO4, 60 mEq of KCL.  Repeat cardiac enzymes drawn at the time were significant for a troponin-T of 3.73 but with a CK of 133 (303) and CK-MB of 5.2 (16.2).

Echo 3/24/63
The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic function is impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic with regional variation, the mid ventricule and the apex are most involved. Function is best preserved at the base.  There is aneurysmal dilatation of the LV apex.  The transmitral velocity filling patterns are c/w delayed relaxation.  The estimated ejection fraction is 38 %.Mild MR, mild TR, septal hypertrophy

CXR 3/22/64EXTENSIVE BILATERAL PULMONARY EDEMA AND BILATERAL SMALL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS, RIGHT GREATER THAN LEFT, WITH ASSOCIATED RELAXATION ATELECTASIS, COMPATIBLE WITH RADIOGRAPHIC APPEARANCE OF CHF. SUBSEGMENTAL ATELECTASIS AT THE RIGHT BASE.

Cardiac Cath 3.23.64
	LAD proximal 80% stenosis, 85% Cx stenosis, distal RCA with wedge of 25 mm Hg.

EKG
	Sinus rhythm, left anterior hemiblock, ST elevations in V1-3 unchanged from previous EKGs.
A/P: 81 yo man with a history of DM2, HTN, CRI who presented with a NSTEMI and CHF.  He had a cardiac catheterization with significant three-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous intervention and will now get evaluation for CABG. he has just experienced a 15-beat run of MMVT. 
Cardiovascular
Rhythm:  He apparently had no known episodes of  dysrhythmias in the SDU.  His arrhythmia is likely due to re-entrant circuits due to scars and fibrosis due to his MI.
Will increase beta-blocker dose to 25 mg po q8h, titrate up aggressively as tolerated.
On cardiac telemetry
Will replete K, Mg to goals of > 1.8 and >4 respectively
Pt awaiting CABG, but is on the borderline of criteria for AICD placement if CABG doesn   t happen.
Will consider amiodarone if further runs of VT, will move to ICU care
Ischemia:  Has CRI, and just had a NSTEMI with a Troponin peak at 2.91 on 3/23, but now with an increase to 3.73. He has significant 3-vessel disease on catheterization. 
 Will continue ASA/BB/Statin/Heparin.  
Will hold Plavix for planned CABG. 
Cardiology, Cardiac Surgery following
Will cycle cardiac biomarkers x 3
Pump: He was in florid pulmonary edema on presentation, LV diffusely hypokinetic with an EF 38%.  
Will continue Lasix 60 mg iv bid.
Started on low-dose of captopril 3/24, he has DM, so will continue unless CRI worsens significantly
CHF:   Presented with acute CHF, with Sp02 of 85% in ED.  Now asymptomatic and stable Sp02 s/p diuresis.
Will continue iv Lasix 60 mg bid.
CRI
Likely due to DM2, HTN
Will continue ACEi
Neuro:   He is a little confused at baseline and has the risk factors of advanced age, DM and HTN for neuro-cognitive dysfunction after CABG.
Will get Neurology consult, 
Will check Carotid Doppler studies.
FEN:  
Tolerating Cardiac diet.
DM
RISS
Prophylaxis
Will d/c iv Zantac, start Nexium.  On Heparin.
Goals of Hospitalization
To treat his dysrhythmia and  optimize his management before CABG

RE:  Michael Isenberg

HCC# - 367-41-93



Dear Dr. Uher:



I saw our mutual patient, Mr. Isenberg, today in my office for a routine followup wound check.  As you know, this is an 81 year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes.  He underwent an off-pump double bypass on 3/31/64.  He had an excellent post-operative recovery being discharged on day five.  Since home, he reports having no further symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain.  He has been gradually increasing his daily activity and is now walking about five to ten minutes a day and two flights of steps.  I have suggested that he gradually increase his daily exercise.



On examination today his heart rate was 80 and regular.  His chest incision was well healed and his sternum stable.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  He had mild edema at his right ankle and a well-healed endoscopic vein harvest site.  His current medications are aspirin 325 a day, Nexium 20 a day, Lisinopril 2.5 a day, Atenolol 25 a day, Plavix 75 a day, Glimepiride 1 mg. PO b.i.d., and Lipitor 80 mg. a day.



Overall, I am obviously delighted to see Mr. Isenberg having recovered without complication from his revascularization.  I trust that you have received a copy of his Discharge Summary previously.  If not please let me know and we   ll forward you this.  Thanks for letting us participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman and let me know if I can be of further assistance.



Sincerely,





Ian K. Ignacio, M.D.

CC: 	 SOB

HPI: 	Mr. Isenberg is an 82-year-old male with a past history significant for HTN, DM, CRI, COPD, and BPH.  He recently underwent a two vessel CABG in April 2064. At that time he had presented to HCC in CHF and w/ an NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the LAD and LCx territory and moderate disease in the RCA. He underwent CABG on 03/31/2064, off-pump, w/ a LIMA to the LAD graft and an SVG to the circumflex OM. His post-operative course was uncomplicated.
He presented to DSH on 8/14 w/ SOB, found to be in CHF (BNP 482). He denies any chest pain and at DSH he had no ischemic EKG changes but was found to have positive cardiac biomarker w/ an initial TnI of 0.6 rising to 23.8 o/n. His biomarkers continue to rise and on transfer were CK 745 and CK-MB of 80.3 with a fraction of 10.7%. He was transferred to HCC where he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated continued severe disease in his native vessels as well as significant stenosis of his LIMA at its touch-down and complete occlusion of his SVG. A PA line and an IABP were placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.

8/15/64     NSR w/ L axis, Q   s in V1-V2 w/ 1mm ST elevations, 1mm ST depression in V5.

Assessment:
	In summary this is an 82-year-old male with a past history significant for HTN, DM, CRI, COPD, and BPH s/p a 2V CABG 4/ 2064 who presented to an OSH w/ SOB, found to be in CHF w/ an NSTEMI. Catheterization s/p transfer to HCC demonstrated diffuse native disease as well as complete occlusion of SVG and touchdown lesion of LIMA. No intervention taken w/ plan to return to Cath lab for rotor intervention on Wednesday. 
 
Plan: 
CV     Ischemia: S/p NSTEMI
Continue ASA and once PTT normalizes initiate Argatroban as some concern for HIT exists, will 
aim for goal of PTT 40-50.
Titrate up Beta-blockade and ACE-I once CHF improved. Restart Statin in AM.
Pull sheaths once PTT <60 per protocol
EKG on arrival, w/ CP and in AM
Plan for rotor intervention on Wednesday of this week
CV     Pump: presentation w/ CHF, now dry
PA line in place (but heparinized line) plan to shoot numbers and likely D/C there after
Per report w/ PCWP at 12 in Cath lab, will check BNP to have baseline.
IABP placed in Cath lab w/ some difficulty, 
CV     Rhythm - NSR
NSR at present, observe on cardiac telemetry, replete K and Mg as needed
CRI     baseline Cr 1.6-1.8
Bicarb drip and Mucomyst post catheterization
DM     FSBG QAC+HS and RISS, at home on oral therapy
Check HgbA1C
Heme - ? HIT per report, unlikely given time course
Check HIT Ab, d/c Heparin from all lines and drips
Prophy     Nexium and Argatroban

                                                         Date of Visit: 9/10/2064



Vascular Surgery Consult Note:



I am asked to examine Mr. Isenberg and comment on recent CT findings of a intraluminal defect in the right subclavian artery.



PMH / PSH:

1.	CAD - S/p  2-V CABG off pump in 4/64

2.	CHF- EF 38%, mild MR, diffusely hypokinetic LV w/ apical aneurysm, RVSP 46mmHg, upper 

segment septal hypertrophy w/o evidence of obstruction on TTE on 3/24/64

3.	HTN

4.	Hyperlipidemia

5.	DMII

6.	CRI- Baseline Pcr is between 1.6-1.8



Medications: 

Plavix 75 mg qd

Aspirin 325 mg qd

Lipitor 80 mg qd

Lisinopril 2.5 mg qd

Atenolol 25 mg qd

Fluoxetine 10 mg qd

 	 	 	 	

Allergies: NKDA





Mr Isenberg is a 82 yo gentleman one week out from attempted placement of right subclavian pacemaker- complicated by brief arterial puncture, prompt removal of the arterial catheter and successful compression. Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as: 



" Hematoma around right subclavian artery.  Narrowing of the artery. Apparent filling defect, most likely artifactual.  If thrombus is of clinical concern, upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained."



On physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall. His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses. There are no thrills or bruits.



My review of arterial components of the CT show the following:

1). Hematoma- to be expected

2). Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.

3). Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.

4). Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.



Based on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order. This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it. He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable. There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.
