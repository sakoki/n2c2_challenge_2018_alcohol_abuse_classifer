CARDIOLOGY

SABINE MEDICAL CENTER



Reason for visit:

   Follow up: NSVT and history of VF Arrest



Interval History:

   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today. His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.



His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.  Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.  Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.



He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring "rarely", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol.  The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.



He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.



Past medical history:

   DMII, CAD, s/p CABG, VF Arrest Hypercholesterolemia, 1st Degree AV block, RBBB, NSVT



Medications (Confirmed):



			

Dalmane 30 mg

glyburide 2.5mg po qd

Lipitor 20 mg

lisinopril 5 mg po qd

metformin hydrochloride 500 mg

Nexium 40mg po qd



Physical examination:

-BP: 110/70  

-Pulse: 50  

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ pedal pulses.



EKG:

   Sinus Bradycardia 50bpm, 1st degree AV block PR 290ms, RBBB. Compared to previous EKGs, PR interval is slightly longer.



Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath. I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise. We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.  We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.



The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.

Re:  	Quijano, Donny 

	SMC Unit # 544-84-52



Dear Dr. Galvan:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Quijano, in followup for episodes of dyspnea, in the setting of asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, myasthenia gravis and distant coronary disease.



He reports that his    spasms    of unpredictable exertional breathlessness have continued to be substantially in remission, occurring less than once a week and sometimes only every two weeks.  Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances.  



No cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections.



No reflux symptoms.



Sneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months.



He enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells.



Medications:  Advair, 100/50, one puff b.i.d. (continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.



On examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self.  Blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sinuses nontender.  Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation.  Oropharynx:  Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates.  No goiter or adenopathy.  Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes.  Cardiac:  Vague cardiac impulse, 1/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3.  Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Skin:  Well tanned.



Pulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3.



CT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries.



Impression:



Episodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair.



Probable mild occult gastroesophageal reflux.



Ischemic coronary disease, status post VF arrest and revascularization.



Myasthenia, mainly ocular.



Prior Raynaud's syndrome.



Recommendations:



Continue Advair at the current dose.



Trial of Singulair, 10 mg p.o. q. p.m.



Low threshold for adding a proton-pump inhibitor and/or intranasal steroids.



Continue exercise program.



Return visit in three months with pulmonary function tests at that time.



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.



Sincerely yours,







Dean S. Nye, M.D.

Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

Cardiac arrest while skiing January 2072; cath showed 70% distal left main, 90% proximal LAD, 90% first diagonal, 60% left circumflex, 40% first marginal, RCA normal.  Underwent 3-vessel bypass (SVGs to the LAD, diagonal, OM).  Last ETG January 2076 showed an equivocal mild apical reversible defect.  Remains asymptomatic.  Cardiovascular exam stable.  Update ECG.  He continues to see Dr.  Middleton periodically.



Diabetes mellitus

Metformin 1000 mg BID.  Added low-dose glyburide 1.25 mg QD in October, for hemoglobin A1c 7.80.  Followup hemoglobin A1c last month better, 7.10.  Asked him to concentrate more on diet.  Says he is up-to-date with Ophthalmology.     05/25/2077:   He remains asymptomatic.  Check A1c and urine albumin/creatinine ratio today.



Hyperlipidemia

Lipitor 10 mg QD.  Tolerating well.  Check followup lipids, CK, and transaminases.  Target LDL 70.02/27/2077:  Recent lipid profile excellent with LDL 72, HDL 70, triglycerides 46, and total cholesterol 151.  Serum CPK, June 2076, SGOT 74, and SGPT 41.  Review of prior test results discloses chronic low-grade elevation serum CK. Spoke with the patient; no myalgias, arthralgias, or fevers. Possibly related to Lipitor.  Discontinue, substitute pravastatin.  Return in four weeks to recheck CK and transaminases.  The patient understands.  Call in the meantime for problems or questions.     05/25/2077:   Now on pravastatin without side effects.  CK unchanged.  Continue to follow.

Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

Metformin 1000 mg BID, glyburide 1.25 mg QD.  He is trying to be much more disciplined with his diet and as a result, according to his wife, he is experiencing fairly frequent minor hypoglycemic episodes.  His last hemoglobin A1c six months ago was 6.50.  Recheck today.  I suspect we will be able to discontinue the glyburide.  Urine albumin/creatinine ratio within normal limits six months ago.



Coronary artery disease

Cardiac arrest January 2072 while skiing; multivessel disease on cath; underwent three-vessel bypass (SVGs to the LAD, diagonal, OM).  Most recent ETT January 2076 showed equivocal mild apical reversible defect.  Remains active, has had no chest discomfort of any kind or palpitations.  Continue medical management.



Myasthenia gravis

Remains on Mestinon.  Denies symptoms.



Hyperlipidemia

Remains on pravastatin.  Total cholesterol 151, HDL 70, LDL 72, triglycerides 46 February 2077.  Complains of occasional leg spasms but has no fevers or GI symptoms.  Check CK and transaminases.



Asthma

He continues to be followed by Dr.  Nye; see his notes.  Continues to have occasional episodes of very minor shortness of breath at rest, never with exercise.  Lungs clear.  Doing well.



Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Documented on barium swallow 2069.  Compliant with PPI.  No symptoms.



Anemia

Longstanding issue, hematocrit in mid 30s, MCV mid 90s, iron studies, ferritin, B12, and folate unremarkable.  Check TSH, SPEP.05/25/2077:   TSH and SPEP unremarkable.  Check EPO level, follow CBC.     11/21/2077:   EPO level inappropriately low.  Therefore, suspect anemia is secondary to age-related reduction in renal mass/GFR.



Hypertension

On low-dose ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  Blood pressure today uncharacteristically elevated, 150/70.  He attributes this to rushing to get to his appointment with me.  Blood pressure earlier this month was 120/55 at his pulmonary visit.  I suspect that he is probably well controlled overall.  For now, no change in management.
