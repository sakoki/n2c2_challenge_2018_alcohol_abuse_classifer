findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is an extraordinarily

complex 47-year-old patient with renal insufficiency, nephrotic

syndrome, and severe anemia who was scheduled to receive some

intravenous iron today but the presence of multiple abnormalities

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Elmore.  Resident's

note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me, and

I confirm the resident's findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, Ms. Kimbrough is a

46-year-old woman with history of hypothyroidism, anxiety,

diabetes, and nephrotic syndrome.  She is also dialysis

dependent.  Her last dialysis was yesterday, she developed acute

onset chest pressure with severe shortness of breath and

diaphoresis while at home.  Called EMS and was brought to the

Emergency Department.  The patient is unable to give a full

history and at this time secondary to her significant respiratory

distress.  Please review resident's note for full details of

obtainable past medical history, social history, review of

systems, medications, and allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.

 Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted

at 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask.  Physical exam

reveals a diaphoretic woman who is breathing rapidly with

accessory muscle use, nasal flaring and tripoding.  She has rales

halfway up bilaterally with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. 

Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia.  Abdomen is obese but soft. 

Extremity exam reveals bilateral 3+ edema up to the knees. 

Rectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.

On route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual

nitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.  She is known to make urine, a

Foley catheter was placed immediately.  IV access was

established, and the patient received large doses of diuretics. 

Was immediately started on IV nitroglycerin and a BiPAP.  On

BiPAP, the patient's oxygenation was 100%.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit

of 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1.  BNP was noted at

700.  Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was

less than assay.  However, labs were obtained within half an hour

of her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6.  Urinalysis

was negative and urine HCG was negative.  EKG was sinus

tachycardia without any ST or T-wave changes concerning for

rate-related ischemia.  There were no prior EKGs available. 

Chest x-ray showed bilateral CHF.  The Nephrology fellow covering

hemodialysis was notified that the patient would need immediate

hemodialysis and this was scheduled for 6:00 a.m.

DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, and

CHF.

ASSESSMENT:  Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, it is

likely that she had an ischemic event that caused flash pulmonary

edema and subsequent symptomatology.  Given the current regimen,

in the Emergency Department, the patient gradually improved.  The

respiratory rate was noted at 23.  Her heart rate came down to

113 and blood pressure was well controlled on the IV

nitroglycerin noted finally at 140/77.  The patient was taken to

hemodialysis at 7:45 and admitted to the hospital thereafter for

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Penn, whose note was

reviewed and confirmed by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old woman with

end-stage renal disease secondary to minimal chain disease, on

hemodialysis, presenting with severe hypertension, headache,

nausea, and vomiting in the setting of blood pressures in the

200s/100s today.

Please review resident's note for full details of past medical

history, social history, review of systems, medications, and

allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake, alert, and appears to be in

mild to moderate discomfort.  Vital signs reveal pulse of 108,

respirations 22, blood pressure 226/129, and oximetry is 96% on

room air.  The patient is afebrile.  HEENT exam reveals well

visualized disks bilaterally on funduscopic exam.  There is no

papilledema noted.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  Lungs are clear

to auscultation with good air movement throughout.  Heart is

regular.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremity exam reveals no cyanosis,

clubbing, or edema.  Neurologic:  The patient is intact.  There

is a left brachiocephalic shunt noted with a good thrill easily

palpable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is 5.4, hematocrit 45, BUN and

creatinine 31 and 6.0, potassium is noted at 5.3%, cardiac

enzymes flat, and coags are unremarkable.

IMAGING STUDIES:  EKG is sinus rhythm without any ST or T-wave

changes concerning for ischemia.  Head CT shows no acute

processes.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was given IV fluids and

treated with Zofran for her nausea, labetalol 200 mg p.o.

followed by 10 mg intravenously, which brought her pressure down

very nicely to 168/86.  After fluids, Zofran, and blood pressure

control, her symptoms improved dramatically.  She was admitted to

the Observation Unit to monitor her blood pressure overnight with

anticipated discharge in the morning.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertensive urgency.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old female who returns to the clinic for a followup visit.  The patient has multiple medical problems including severe and extreme hypertension as well as high blood pressure and chronic renal failure for which she is currently attending dialysis sessions 3 times per week.  The patient also is currently being treated for hot flashes with Prempro.  The patient states that she ran out of her blood pressure medications including the patch 2 days ago.  She also complains of frequent popping and loss of hearing in her right ear.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A middle-aged female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 182/94, weight is 211 pounds, and pulse is 76.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2.  Negative S3, S4, no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities, no edema, nontender.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Chronic renal failure, on dialysis.  The patient appears to be doing much better and has stabilized on her regular dialysis sessions.  She is still waiting for donor for a renal transplant.  She will follow up with nephrology as scheduled.  She is currently being immunized for her transplant and will receive her third hepatitis B shot as well as her second hepatitis A shot today.

2.  Right ear problem.  The patient has wax buildup in her right ear and I recommended that she use olive oil on a nightly basis to resolve the earwax.

3.  Diabetes mellitus.  Control is much better.  There is a recent hemoglobin A1c of 6.3.

4.  Severe hyperlipidemia, which has improved after the patient was started on dialysis.  Of note, was also a very high HDL.  The patient is currently on no hypolipemic medication.  We will check a fasting lipid profile at this point.

5.  Severe hypertension.  Prescriptions for nifedipine and the clonidine patch were refilled.

6.  Hyperparathyroidism.  We will check a PTH level today.
