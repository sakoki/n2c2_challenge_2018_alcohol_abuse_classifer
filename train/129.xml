Record date: 2072-10-28

She's doing much better from her painful R facial weakness (? Ramsay Hunt syndrome).  She di dnot take tegretol, but rather increased her amytriptiline and added some darvocet acutely, now off these meds.  Her R eye "tears a lot", at no particular time (ie, not necessarily when she's masticating), and occasionally it burns....but she has not developed conjunctivitis or ocular redness or discharge.  She has difficulty chewing opn the R side of her mouth, and finds she"pockets" food in her R cheek; she manages by chewing on L, and swallowing frequently, especially taking extra liquids.

The pain has receded-  she now only gets "a twinge" now and then.



Husband has noticed she's not hearing quite as well.



Her current meds include amitryptiline 25 hs, mevacor 20, procardia 30 bid, furosemide 40x3, isosorbide 20 qd allopurinol 300 qd.  She's releived to learn the results of her recent blood work, including BUN 65 Creat 3.4, Hct 29.8



On exam, she has gained weight since I last saw her; she comes in ok0on wheelchair, but is able to take a few steps with her straight cane, and climb onto the examining tabloe with only contact guard. Dense catarcts; fundi not visualized; EOMS full without ptosis or nystagmus. Cornelas are brisk pilaterally, but she has decreased sensationon the R lower facial segments (V1, V2); excellent masseter and temporalis strength. R lower facial weakness, with less evident weakness of orbicularis oculi; he manages to close the eyelid almost completely; + Bell's phenomenon.  She hears finger rub at 90 cm on R, 70 cm on L; Weber lateralizes to the R, but Rinne' positive bilatyerally (ie, AC>BC AU). Tongue midline.  Modulates voice well.  TMs opaque, but EACs clear.



She has a marked polyneuropathy, with decreased vibration from knuckles to elbows bilaterally Hyporeflexia throughout, but symmetrical.  Strength remains well conserved.



IMP: improving R Bell's. MRI showed much motion, but no gross abnormalities



Plan- continue with current management. I'd welcome the oportunity of seeing her again in about 6 months.

Patient Name: FALLON, SHARON;  MRN: 1703242
Dictated on: 11/11/2074 by PATRICIA DRAKE, N.P., PH.D. 

 
HISTORY:  Mrs. Fallon returns to clinic for evaluation and management of a right posterior ankle ulceration.  Since her last visit to the clinic, she was evaluated by Dr. Frederick Archer who admitted her for a diagnostic angiogram, which revealed that she had adequate perfusion to the ankle level 
to heal the ulceration.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, Mrs. Fallon has ruborous discoloration of the distal half of her bilateral lower extremity with scattered vesicles on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity.  The 
ulceration is on the posterior aspect of the right ankle.  It measured 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm.  The tissue is moist yellow subcutaneous tissue, the margin is clear.  In the setting of ruborous discoloration, it appears that Mrs. Fallon may have an acute flare of her chronic lipodermatosclerosis.   
PLAN:  Daily wound care per the following protocol; 1.  Normal saline irrigation 30 cc x 3.  A thin layer of 50% Diprolene ointment 0.05% with Bactroban cream to the wound bed and the wide periwound margin.  Primary dressing will be Telfa covered with rolled gauze.  Mrs. Fallon will return to clinic in 2 weeks unless the wound bed is closed and then she will follow up with Dr. Archer on Tuesday, November 26th.

MITRAL VALVE

There is evidence of thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet.  There is

calcification of the anterior and posterior mitral annulus.  There is no

evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  The peak transmitral gradient is 10 mmHg.

The mean transmitral gradient is 5 mmHg.  There is mild to moderate mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM

The left atrium is dilated.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or

spectral Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function approaches the lower limits of normal.  There is symmetric left

ventricular hypertrophy.  There is segmental apical left ventricular

dysfunction (see wall motion plot).  There is no evidence of left ventricular

thrombus.  The estimated ejection fraction is 51 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function

is within normal limits.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is a space between

visceral and parietal pericardium most c/w pericardial fat.



CONCLUSIONS

Compared to the study of 9/12/73, the EF has dropped by 10% and apical wall

motion abnormalities are now noted.





CCU Course/Plan	

72 year old woman with ESRD, positive troponin in setting SOB and pulmonary oedema on CXR. Suspect  leak  from demand.  



1)	ischemia: ASA, BB. Would doubt she needs urgent cath but will hold NPO for potential cath in am.  Would not add heparin. Check fasting lipids.



2)	rhythm: so far not an issue. BB as tolerated. 



3)	pump: she has LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction.  Would prefer to have ACE on board - will d/w renal as to why not.



4)	ESRD - can go for HD today. Need to contact dialysis unit to arrange time.



5)	DM 2 - SSI for now, will likely give back Lantus tonight. She is v reluctant to have SSI, will give at half usual doses.



6)	FEN cardiac, diabetic diet. Hold NPO pending possible cath in am.



7)	Prophylaxis: GI: Nexium, DVT: Heparin IV; BM: prn. 



8)	Dispo - to SDU today

CC:  73 yo woman admitted with recurrent hypotension preventing hemodialysis



HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time. Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074. Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG. In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal. She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD. She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.  Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position. She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea. She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain. Lower extremity swelling continues to be a problem and she is complaining of left heel pain.



PMH: ESRD as a result of DM on HD, DM related retinopathy/neuropathy; h/o infected tunneled catheter; hyperparathyroidism; HTN in the past; CAD s/p NSTEMI 12/74, echo in Jan 2074 showed EF 52%; CHF;  PVD with RLE ulcer followed by Dr. Archer; h/o  GI bleed with negative upper endoscopy , pending colonoscopy, umbilical and hiatal hernia, cervical CA 6 years ago s/p hysterectomy; gout; benign breast tumor; h/o DVT s/p filter placement; h/ hypercalcemia, depression



PSH: TAH 6 years ago; left arm AV fistula s/p thrombectomy x 2, most recently one week ago



Medications: Allopurinol 200 po qd, Mevacor 20 po qd, Quinine 350 po BID, Concerta 3 tabs qd, Colace, Pericolace, Tylenol #3 prn, Nephrocaps 1 tab po qd, ASA 81 po qd, Lantus insulin 50 units qam, Tums 1 tab po tid with meals

Alternative meds: None

Allergies: MSO4 cause SOB; Novocaine causes seizure



Family history: Non-contributory



Social history: Lives at home with husband of 34 years, two children from previous marriage live in the area, has grandchildren. Used to work in construction.



Risks: Never use tobacco, rarely used alcohol, no injection drug use



Review of systems: (+) some vaginal blood spotting recently. No recent HA, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, abdominal pain.



PE: Elderly, pale woman in NAD. T 97.7 degrees, BP 117/62, HR 84, RR 24, Sat 99% on RA. HEENT: NC,ST, PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, non-injected, arcus senilis no oto/rhinorrhea, oral mucosa moist, no cervical LAD or tenderness, no thyromegaly, neck supple, no supraclavicular LAD or bruits. HEART- RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no S3, S4 or murmur. PULM- CTA bilaterally with moderate to good BS bilaterally, no wheeze, rales or rhonchi. ABD- soft, NT, ND, BS+, reducible herniano HSM or masses, no aortic, hepatic or renal bruits. EXT- Bilateral brawny edema of LE. SKIN- changes if chronic venous statis of LE with tender shallow fissure of left heel. NEURO- A/O x 3, conversant, well-formed sentences, appropriate although somewhat flat, but laughed occasionally, CN 2-12 intact, visual fields intact bilaterally, DTRs 1+ and symmetric in triceps, biceps, quads and achilles, strength 4/5 bilateral U and LE



Data: Na 136, K 5.6, Cl 96, HCO3 29, BUN 69, Cr 10.2, Glu 96, Ca 9.3, PO4 6.9, Mg 2.0, Alb 2.9; WBC 12.2 no diff, HCT 32.7, PLT 247; PT 13.5, PTT 24



ECG: NSR with occasional ectopy, RBBB and 1st degree AV block, no e/o ischemia or infarction



Imaging:  CXR today shows pulmonary venous hypertension with interstitial edema and small pleural effusions bilaterally. Patchy opacity at the left lung base most likely represents alveolar edema or atelectasis.



CODE status: Unknown



Focused problem list:  Hypotension limiting hemodialysis s/p MI 3 months ago, DM, neuropathy, depression



A/P: 73 year old woman with likely autonomic instability resulting from long-standing diabetes. In order to effectively counter the level of hypotension that she experiences after HD, she may benefit from interventions that will raise the systemic BP.



1)	Blood pressure

-   Adenosine-stress MIBI today

-	If the above is OK, plant to start midodrine 5 mg po tid



2)	Renal failure

-   Check lytes in AM

-	To HD in AM

-	Already received kayexalate in EW tonight

-	Increase Tums to 2 tabs po tid with meals for hyperphosphatemia



3)	Vaginal spotting

-   Pt has a gynecologist here at RH, will contact re: imaging vs other, esp in setting of h/o cervical CA

-	HCT stable
